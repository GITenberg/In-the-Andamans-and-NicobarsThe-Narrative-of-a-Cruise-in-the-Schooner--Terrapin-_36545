<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages are the result of an attempt to record a cruise,
in a schooner, to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bengal
Sea, the main purpose of which was to obtain good representative
collections (now in the National Museum, Washington, U.S.A.) of
natural history and ethnological objects from the places visited.
Special attention was given to the trapping of small mammals,
which, comprising the least known section of the island fauna,
were the most interesting subject for investigation. Sixteen new
varieties were obtained in the Andamans and Nicobars together,
thus raising the known mammalian fauna of those islands from
twenty-four to forty individuals, while the collections also included
ten hitherto undescribed species of birds. All the collecting and
preparation was done by my companion, whose guest I was, and
myself, for we were accompanied by no native assistants or
hunters. Broadly speaking, one half of the day passed in obtaining
specimens, the other in preserving them; and such observations
as I have been able to chronicle were, for the greater part,
made during the periods of actual collecting and the consequent
going to and fro.</p>

<p>In order to give a certain completeness to the account, I have
included a more or less general description of the two Archipelagoes,
their inhabitants, etc.; the chapters of this nature are
partly compiled from the writings of those who had had previous
experience of the islands, and for the most part the references
have been given.</p>

<p>I cannot but regard the illustrations, which are a selection
from my series of photographs, as the most valuable part of this
work, but I hope that my written record, in spite of its imper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>fections,
may stimulate some more competent observer and
chronicler than myself to visit the latter islands&mdash;for the Andamans
have already been described<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> in an admirable monograph
by one who dwelt there for many years&mdash;before it is too late.
Ethnically, much remains to be done, and every day that goes
by produces some deterioration of native life and custom. To
this end I have added many details about supplies, anchorages,
etc., that might otherwise seem superfluous.</p>

<p>Of those who entertained and assisted us during the voyage,
thanks are specially due to Mr P. Vaux of Port Blair, for his
hospitality to us during our stay in that place;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and I am
greatly indebted to Messrs O. T. Mason, G. S. Miller, and Dr
C. W. Richmond, respectively, for the photographs of the Nicobarese
pottery and skirt, for permission to include here much
information from the report on the Andaman and Nicobar
mammals, and for a list of the new species of birds obtained,
which, however, up to the present, have not received specific
designations. I have also to gratefully acknowledge the help
rendered me by Mr E. H. Man, C.I.E., who, besides volunteering
to read through the proof sheets, has given me much information,
and corrected a number of inaccuracies. To my sister, for her
superintendence of the book since my departure from England,
and to my publishers for their kindness and assistance in many
ways, I must not omit to offer my thanks.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="pblockquot">The <i>Terrapin</i>&mdash;Crew&mdash;Itinerary of the Cruise&mdash;Daily Routine&mdash;Provisions
and Supplies&mdash;Collecting Apparatus&mdash;Guns&mdash;Shooting&mdash;Path-making&mdash;Clothing&mdash;Head-dress&mdash;A
Scene in the Tropics&mdash;Native Indolence&mdash;Attractive
Memories.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Terrapin</i>, captain and owner Dr W. L. Abbott, is a
Singapore-built teak schooner of 40 tons register and 67 tons
yacht measurement. She is 65 feet long on the water-line, and 16
feet broad, and has been given an almost box-shaped midship
section, partly to afford sufficient inside space for the ballast (iron),
but principally with the idea that when she takes the ground she
may not heel to any uncomfortable extent. The draught is 7&frac12; feet,
but two years' experience has proved that this is too much for the
class of cruising she is engaged in. The crew are berthed forward,
and aft is a large hold where tanks containing about 3 tons of water,
supplies, cables, etc., are stored. A large raised trunk hatch about
2&frac12; feet high covers the central third of the boat, leaving 3-feet
gangways on either side. This structure affords ample head-room
below, and gives coolness and abundant ventilation by means of
windows which open all round it. Sailing in the tropics, with the
thermometer constantly standing at 84&deg; or so in the shade,
necessitates for any comfort a very different arrangement from
what would be fitting at home. Whenever possible, the boat, while
anchored, is covered with awnings from stem to stern. Under the
hatch are a large saloon, two cabins, pantry, etc.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>The crew&mdash;five ordinary seamen, a <i>serang</i> (boatswain), and
sailing-master&mdash;are Malays; for natives are far more satisfactory in
nearly every way on a small boat in the tropics than white men,
even if the latter could be obtained. They can put up with more
restricted quarters, are less inclined to grumble under the peculiar
circumstances, or be disobedient, are more at home in every way
in the surroundings and with the people one meets, are little
trouble to cater for, and, most important of all, keep in good
health and can stand the sun. A Chinese "boy" and cook are
also carried.</p>

<p>Forward on deck there is a small iron galley for the preparation
of meals, and aft repose two boats&mdash;an 18-feet double-ender
for four oars, and a beamy 10-feet dinghy that best carries a
crew of three. The schooner steers with a wheel.</p>

<p>The <i>Terrapin</i> left Singapore in October 1900 and, subsequent
to calling at Penang, cruised off the coast of Tenasserim and
among the islands of the Mergui Archipelago until I joined her
late in December. A few days were then spent in the peninsula,
where several deer and wild pig were obtained; then visiting High
Island&mdash;where an unsuccessful search was made for Sellung<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
skeletons, and a number of birds and small mammals added to the
collection&mdash;she left for the Andamans.</p>

<p>On the return voyage from the Nicobars we called at Olehleh,
the port for Kota Rajah, Dutch capital of Acheen. Even a
dissociation from them of only three months made the pink-white
skins of the Europeans&mdash;sun-avoiding Dutch&mdash;seem
strange and unhealthy.</p>

<p>Having spent a day or two at this place, where we first heard of
the accession of King Edward VII., we skirted the north coast of
Sumatra, with its park-like stretches of grass and forest, drifting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
along almost in the shadow of its great volcanic mountains, and
then, crossing the northern entrance of the Malacca Straits,
anchored once more in the harbour of Penang.</p>

<p>At Klang, in Selangor, we stopped a night to visit the museum
at Kwala Lumpor, and were passed by the <i>Ophir</i> and her consorts
as they steamed to Singapore; which place we ourselves reached,
after a slow passage down the coast, on the 27th of April 1901, thus
bringing the cruise to an end.</p>

<p>The day's programme during the voyage was simple. We rose
before 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>; and after a hurried <i>chota hazri</i>, rowed ashore the
moment it grew at all light. The next five hours were passed
collecting in the jungle; and then returning on board, after a bath,
change, and breakfast, the preservation of specimens went on until
two o'clock; next came tea, then more work until about 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
when we once more rowed ashore and sought for fresh material
until darkness set in. Then after another bath and change came
dinner, and by the time the second batch of specimens was disposed
of, we were quite ready for mattress and pillow on deck; for
unless it rained we never slept below. The development of
photographs often kept me up till midnight, since they had to be
manipulated in a small pantry which could only be thoroughly
darkened after sunset. I have seldom been in a warmer place.</p>

<p>Some consideration should be given to the provisioning of a
boat when cruising away from regular supplies for health is
largely dependent on this point.</p>

<p>For so long as flour will keep good it is pleasant to have fresh
bread, but experience on this and other cruises is that it gets full
of weevils after three months in a small boat. While tinned
provisions and bottled fruits are very well for a time, one rapidly
tires of them, and then there is nothing like the old stand-bys
of salt beef and pork, ship's biscuits, rice, etc. Potatoes and onions
will keep well for six months, and "sauerkraut," or Chinese
preserved greens, are useful articles. Many of the birds shot for
specimens&mdash;on this cruise, megapodes, pigeons, and whimbrel&mdash;form
welcome additions to the table, and one gets occasionally
wild pig and deer; while even of such unorthodox animals as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
squirrels, the larger kinds&mdash;<i>Sciurus bicolor</i> attains almost the size
of a hare, which it much resembles in flavour&mdash;are by no means
despicable. When we were under sail, there were always lines
towing astern of the vessel, which often produced bonito, dolphin,
barracouta, edible shark, and other varieties, and we carried a
seine, which, when stretched across the mouth of a tidal creek,
was nearly always certain to entangle some kind of fish in its
meshes, while with a casting-net catches of what one might call
"whitebait" were often made.</p>

<p>One is rarely able to obtain much else than fowls from natives,
and except in towns and large villages, where there are regular
bazaars and markets, even fruit other than coconuts and bananas
is scarce. Tinned and bottled preserves soon become insipid to the
palate, but dried fruit, such as apples, apricots and prunes, we found
far more attractive, and they should always be carried when native
supplies are uncertain. In fact, beyond a few necessaries such as
milk, butter, jam, tea, coffee, sugar, cheese and curry stuffs, and
a few more luxurious articles, like soups, pickles&mdash;but those who
have tried a well-seasoned piece of salt junk will admit that these
and mustard are almost absolute necessities&mdash;sauces, etc., the
fewer tinned provisions there are the better, so far as health in
the tropics is concerned. When one can keep the hen-coop well
stocked, and there is plenty of rice on board, one never feels
like grumbling while there is any amount of work to be
done.</p>

<p>In the matter of collecting apparatus, the newer powders are
preferable, as with them there is less chance, through absence of
smoke, of losing sight of the specimen as it falls, which is often the
case otherwise. It is well to have cartridge cases of different
colours for ease in selection, and the sizes of shot most useful seem
to be:&mdash;SSG for pigs, deer, and large monkeys; AA and II for
monkeys, eagles, and other large birds; V for pigeons, and others
of similar size in high tree tops; VIII for the same at moderate
range, and for smaller birds and squirrels, etc., when distant; while
2 drams of powder and &frac12; ounce of XI shot&mdash;the cartridge filled
out by several wads between the two&mdash;is most useful for small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
birds and animals up to 20 yards, and for others at proportionate
distances. For such little things as sunbirds, and for snakes,
lizards, or for point-blank shots, we carried auxiliary barrels, about
9 inches long, that can be slipped in and out of the gun like an
ordinary cartridge, and which fired an extra long .32 calibre
brass cartridge loaded with a pinch of dust shot (No. XIII).
These were invaluable for obtaining the smaller specimens without
smashing, and had a killing range of about 12 yards.</p>

<p>There is no more perfect weapon for the collecting naturalist
than the three-barrelled guns that we used&mdash;shot barrels fully
choked, and the third, placed beneath the others, rifled for long
.380 cartridges. With one of these, the auxiliary barrel, and a
proper selection of cartridges, one is ready for anything that
may turn up other than the larger "big game," for the equipment
is so portable that there is no temptation ever to leave
part of it behind.</p>

<p>The only drawback to such an outfit lies in the time lost in
selecting a suitable cartridge for each shot, but the perfect
specimens obtained by this method are ample compensation for
the extra trouble involved. Even in this way accidents sometimes
happen however, as when on one occasion, while walking through
some grass, a tiny button-quail sprang up, and was knocked over
at close range with what was thought to be a small charge of No.
XI shot. The specimen was not found at once, but as it was the
first of the kind obtained (and has since proved to be of a new
species), the search was persisted in until after a quarter of an
hour a little purple pulp attached to a wing was discovered. The
collector had forgotten which barrel contained the smaller cartridge,
and, pulling the wrong trigger, had fired a full charge of
No. VIII from about that distance in yards, at a wretched little
bird about the size of a sparrow!</p>

<p>To fire at flying birds in the jungle is both wasteful and unprofitable,
for while a bird is only to be seen for a moment as it
flashes between the branches, even if hit, it infallibly becomes lost
in the dense luxuriance of vegetation. The chances in the
favour of the quarry are, however, largely increased by a careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
selection of the smallest cartridge possible on each occasion, often
a tiresome stalk, and a large amount of dodging about to get a
clean shot through the leaves and branches, so that the event is
by no means a more foregone conclusion than sport in the open.</p>

<p>Besides bags for cartridges and specimens, with extractor,
knife, string, cotton-wool, and wrapping paper, it is absolutely
essential, if it is intended to penetrate the jungle at all, that one
should carry some sort of implement&mdash;cutlass, <i>parang</i>, or <i>machet&eacute;</i>&mdash;to
hew a way through the tangled undergrowth.</p>

<p>It is far the best plan, when shooting in the tropics, not to
indulge in a too elaborate outfit. The most suitable and common-sense
clothing consists of a stout cotton suit of pyjamas, grey or
brown in colour for preference, with pockets; the ends of the
trousers should be tied round the ankles with string, to keep out
the ants and leeches, and only when these and thorns are very
bad need stronger trousers and puttees be worn. Such clothes are
easily put on and off, are comfortable, and are not heavy when
soaked with water, rain, and perspiration.</p>

<p>On board ship, when away from civilisation, we invariably
wore a similar dress, or the national garment of Malaya, the
<i>sarong</i>, than which nothing is more comfortable in a hot climate,
unless it be the exceedingly sensible dress of the tropic-dwelling
Chinese.</p>

<p>For head-dress there is no better gear than an old felt hat
(<i>terai</i>), which can be rolled up and put away in the game-bag
when one is in the shade of the forest. In one of the most delightful
books that has been written about the East, the following lines
occur:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "Given a thick jungle, trees 200 feet high, and a mushroom-helmeted
sportsman, it will be seen that comfort and a large
bag are incompatible. A long training in the Sistine Chapel is
necessary for this work. Absurd as it may seem, my spine in the
region of the neck eventually became so sore that I was on more
than one occasion compelled to give myself a rest." With the
latter part of the passage I perfectly concur, for one often stands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
for minutes at a time staring vainly upwards, to where, right overhead,
the specimen that one knows is there, is vocally proclaiming
its presence, and the effect on the back of the neck is, after a
time, often one of excruciating agony. Strangely enough, large
birds like parrots and pigeons are often the most difficult to
see.</p>

<p>But why the helmet in the shade of the forest? We ourselves
never wore hats except when out in the open or going to
and fro between the schooner and the shore, while the sun
was high, and experienced no ill effects from being without
them at other times, although one of us made it a practice to
keep his head shaved for the sake of coolness. Though they
perhaps lay me open to an accusation of thick-headedness, I
mention these facts to show that it is not necessary to burden
oneself with an awkward <i>sola topee</i> with the idea of evading
danger from the sun in such circumstances.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>A cloudless sky and a blazing sun; a long stretch of yellow
beach lapped by a calm sea of brilliant green above the reef, verging
into an intense sapphire in the distance. Inland, swelling hills
clothed in densest jungle&mdash;the topmost ridge capped by a
delicate tracery of foliage that stands out clear cut in the pure
atmosphere. Adjoining the sandy shore a grass-grown level
expanse, with a grove of stately palm trees, through which runs
a rippling brook, and lastly, two or three native huts and their
occupants, so that one can lie, pyjama-clad, in the shade, and
consume young coconuts without first having to climb for
them.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">
"Only to hear and see the far-off brine,<br />
Only to hear were sweet, stretched out beneath the pine."<br />
</p></div>

<p>Is it fair that we should call the native of the tropics lazy
because in some parts of his domain the labour of an hour
supplies his daily wants? The working man of colder climates,
by eight and even twelve hours' occupation, obtains no more, and
often less. The others are the true lotos-eaters, and when one is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
amongst them one often feels, as doubtless they do themselves,
could they formulate their sensations:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"... Why should we toil alone,</span><br />
We only toil who are the first of things,<br />
And make perpetual moan,<br />
Still from one sorrow to another thrown:<br />
<b> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br />
'There is no joy but calm!'<br />
Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?"<br />
</p></div>

<p class="noidt">These are one's thoughts, while captivated by the charm of the
islands, and if feelings change when analysed in more virile
countries, the transformation of ideas only goes to show how
relative to circumstances are such things as industry and idleness.</p>

<p>The foregoing are a few prosaic items about a form of life which,
although when indulged in too long, it perhaps causes now and
again a desire for the amenities of civilisation and a shirt-front,
yet when it is over, always leaves a longing for further experiences
whenever one is haunted by thoughts of the palms, the
sunlight, and the sea; wanderings in the jungle; strange birds,
animals, and vegetation, and pleasant memories of easy-going
islanders.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">We</span> were six days out from land before Barren Island hove
in sight. Since New Year's Day,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> when we got up anchor
amongst the islands of the Mergui Archipelago, the schooner
had been carried by the lightest of breezes towards the Andamans.
The days slipped by, each one as monotonous as its predecessor;
there was no change in the wind, save when it fell calm for a
space, and the sun was so hot that we gladly sought shelter
in the cabin, where occupation might be found with a book.
Once we harpooned a porpoise, but he broke away from the
iron, and now and again, on a line trailing astern, we caught
a small shark, immediately claimed by the cook, to appear later
on the table; for although the name seems instinctively to
prejudice one against them, all sharks are edible, and the
smaller species, which can scarcely include human material
in their dietary scale, are by no means to be despised when
fresh provisions are unobtainable, in spite of being often somewhat
dry and flavourless.</p>

<p>But the nights were ample compensation for any possible
discomfort by day. Around was the calm flat sea, and overhead
a pale blue sky, across which swung the tropic moon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
so bright that all but the larger stars were drowned in light.
Then, when the heat of day was over, we would take our
pillows on deck and&mdash;in a perfect silence but for the creaking
booms and the water gurgling in the scupper-pipes&mdash;watch
mast and stars swing slowly to and fro until sleep brought
unconsciousness of the night and its beauty.</p>

<p>But it is not always so even in the tropics, and the contrary,
and not infrequent, experience, without going to extremes, is
the squall of a moonless night.</p>

<p>As the dense clouds rapidly advance from the horizon and
blot out the stars, one is left in inky darkness broken only by
the glimmer of the lamps in the binnacle. Soon the wind
comes tearing down and whistles loudly in the rigging, while
with lowered sail, the vessel seems to fly through the water&mdash;judging
by the rolling wings of foam that stream from her
shoulders and gleam weirdly in the green and red rays of
the sidelights. Presently the rain falls in a stinging chilly
torrent, killing the breeze and leaving the boat rolling uncomfortably
on the surface; and when the furious downpour is over,
and the night is quiet once more, all that remains to show the
past disturbance is sodden canvas, stiffened cordage, and the
uneasy heave of the wind-whipped sea.</p>

<p>So the squall passes&mdash;generally leaving a calm behind it&mdash;having
in a little space squandered enough unavailing breeze
to have helped the vessel on her course for hours to come.</p>

<p>At last, one evening, we saw Narkondam from the masthead,
about sixty miles away; and next morning Barren Island
had risen above the horizon. These two little islands, eastern
outliers of the Andamans, and connecting links between the
eruptive regions of Burma and Sumatra, are both of volcanic
origin, though the former is now extinct.</p>

<p>Barren Island, about two miles in diameter, is merely
the crater of a volcano rising abruptly from the sea, which,
a quarter of a mile from shore, is nearly everywhere 150 fathoms
or more in depth.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 588px;">
<img src="images/fp010.jpg" width="588" height="437" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE LANDING-PLACE, BARREN ISLAND.</span>
</div>

<p>Approaching from the east, we caught a glimpse, while still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
some distance off, of the black tip of an eruptive cone, showing
above the rim of the crater, which at a nearer view proved to be of
igneous basalt, clothed on the outer slopes with a growth of
creepers, bushes, and of trees 50 to 60 feet high, frequented by
numbers of fruit pigeons.</p>

<p>On the north-west side of the island the wall of the old crater
has been broken down, and a large gap about a hundred yards
wide at the base affords an easy means of access to the interior. It
is through this opening that the best view of the cone is obtained
from seawards.</p>

<p>As we sailed past the gap that afternoon the scene was one of
striking beauty. Against a background of bright blue sky the
little island rose from a sea of lapis-lazuli, which ceaselessly dashed
white breakers on the rocky shores. The steep brown slopes, part
clothed in brilliant green, framed in the cone&mdash;a black and solid
mass, round which a pair of eagles circled slowly.</p>

<p>Fortunately for those vessels which may visit the island, there is
one place off-shore where soundings can be obtained with the
handline, and there we came to anchor in 15 fathoms, a little
beach and clump of coconut palms bearing N.N.E., a quarter of a
mile away.</p>

<p>Sails were soon stowed and we rowed off to reconnoitre the gap,
which is the only practicable landing-place; everywhere else the
land slopes steeply to the sea. To the south a heavy swell was
breaking on the shore, but in the little cove formed here the sea
was perfectly calm, and so clear that as we passed into shallower
water the coral bottom, 10 fathoms down, was plainly visible.</p>

<p>A rough wall of lava about a dozen feet high stretches across
the opening, and to the left of this, among the stones and boulders
of the shore, we found, below high-water mark, a little stream of
fresh water trickling to the sea; it is the only water on the island,
and at that time was at a temperature of 97.5&deg; F.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>The
only inhabitants of any size that the island can boast of
are a large herd of goats, whose well-worn tracks show plainly on
every slope and cliff. A score of these animals, left in 1891 by the
station steamer from Port Blair, have so thriven that their
descendants must now be numbered in hundreds, and are so free
from fear, and unsuspicious, that had we needed them we could
have butchered any quantity.</p>

<p>From the landing-place the ground slopes gently upward to the
floor of the crater, which is about 50 feet above sea level. In the
centre of this rises the little cone of slightly truncated form.
Symmetrical in outline, 1000 feet high and perhaps 2000 feet in
diameter at the base, there is nothing it reminds one of more
closely than a huge heap of purplish-black coal-dust, with patches
and streaks of brown on the top.</p>

<p>To right and left of the base, and thence towards the sea, flows
a broad black stream of clinkery lava, the masses of which it is
composed varying in dimensions from rugged blocks of scori&aelig; a
ton or more in weight to pieces the size of one's fist. The journey
across it would be one of some difficulty, were it not that the
goats, coming from all parts of the island in their need for water,
by constantly travelling to and fro in the same line, have worn a
smooth and deep path from side to side, some 200 yards distant
from the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 677px;">
<img src="images/fp012.jpg" width="677" height="469" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">THE ERUPTIVE CONE, BARREN ISLAND.</span>
</div>

<p>The level ground at the base of the cone, widest on the
southern side, is covered with tall bamboo grass and various
kinds of low bushes. On the inner slopes of the crater, the
south and east sides, which are of rocky formation, support a
certain amount of small forest, in which we quickly noticed the
absence of such tropical forms as palms, rattans and lianas, and
of trees more than 60 or 70 feet high and 4 or 5 feet in diameter;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the remaining sides, composed mainly of volcanic ash, afford
foothold only to a coarse tussocky plant growing in clumps
on the loose black dust. We found these latter slopes not at
all an attractive scene of operations, for the feet sank and slipped
at every step, and raised at the same time clouds of fine black
dust.</p>

<p>During the day the heat in the interior was extreme, for
the sun's rays beat down upon, and were reflected from, the dark
slopes, while the wall of the crater completely cut off any sea
breeze. We did not ascend the cone, for our stay was to be
short, and we wished to investigate the fauna as fully as possible;
but from reports of the visits paid to the island once every three
or four years from Port Blair, it would seem that the slight signs of
activity still existent consist of an issue of steam and the continued
sublimation of sulphur; while of the two cones which form the top,
one is cold, and already bamboo grass and ferns are beginning to
clothe the entire summit. There is ample proof in those details
which have been recorded of the island during the last century
that the volcano is rapidly becoming quiescent, and is indeed,
perhaps verging on a condition of extinction, as has long been
the case with Narkondam.</p>

<p>Captain Blair, who passed near in 1795, writes of enormous
volumes of smoke and frequent showers of red-hot stones. "Some
were of a size to weigh three or four tons, and had been thrown
some hundred yards past the foot of the cone. There were two or
three eruptions while we were close to it; several of the red-hot
stones rolled down the sides of the cone and bounded a considerable
way beyond us.... Those parts of the island that are
distant from the volcano are thinly covered with withered shrubs
and blasted trees."</p>

<p>A few years later Horsburgh records an explosion every ten
minutes, and a fire of considerable extent burning on the
eastern side of the crater. In the next thirty years, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
subterranean forces had considerably diminished in activity,
and at the end of that period only volumes of white smoke
with no flame were to be seen. Drs Mouat and Liebig, who
visited the island within a few months of each other in 1857,
write respectively of volumes of dark smoke, and clouds of hot,
watery vapour. In 1866, a whitish vapour was emitted from
several deep fissures, and about 1890, steam was seen to be
issuing at the top from a sulphur-bed, which was liquid and
pasty, and a new jet was coming from a lump on the sloping
side of the cone; while the sole evidence of activity now to be
observed is the deposition of sulphur, and an escape of steam
that often condenses on the surface rocks.</p>

<p>Concerning the fauna of the island, birds&mdash;inside the crater&mdash;were
not numerous: commonest were a little white-eye
(<i>Zosterops palpebrosa</i>), and the Indian cuckoo, which swarmed
everywhere, its loud cries, "ko-el, ko-el," resounding in all
directions. The only mammals other than the goats were rats,
which, while of one species (<i>Mus atratus</i>, sp. nov.), afford a
rather curious example of range of colouring, for while many
were of the usual brown shade, a great number were of a glossy
coal-black, much resembling in tint the lava and volcanic dust
in which they made their homes. The island is everywhere
riddled with their holes, but though so numerous, the land-crabs
may fairly claim to divide the place with them. Trapping
for rats was a failure, for no sooner was one caught than it would
be torn to pieces by the crabs, who in other instances would
spring the trap long before the others were attracted by the
bait.</p>

<p>Altogether we landed four times, but soon found that very
little variety was to be obtained: the sea, however, swarmed
with fish, and many fine catches of rock-cod, trigger-fish,
and mullet, 20 to 70 lbs. in weight, were made by the
crew.</p>

<p>Late one evening we left Barren Island, and with a
fair though moderate breeze, which, however, soon drew round
against us, covered the 36 miles to the Andamans proper,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
and anchored before noon next day in the Kwang-tung
Juru.</p>

<p>From a distance, all the islands of the Archipelago appear to
rise to about the same height,&mdash;between 500 and 600 feet&mdash;presenting
a fairly level sky-line from north to south, and with the
exception of East Island, which shows a white sandy beach, all
seem fringed with thickets of mangroves.</p>

<p>The strait, which is about a mile wide, separates the islands of
John and Henry Lawrence, and with its smooth water and low
banks, on which the veil of mangrove and jungle, extending to
the water's edge, is broken at short intervals by small bluffs of
pale clay shale, might easily, but for its brilliant blue colour, be
mistaken for a quiet river.</p>

<p>We landed in the afternoon on the eastern shore, and at once
set to work cutting a path, for here was the densest kind of
Andaman jungle, and although within it one comes across little
patches where the bush is fairly open, it is, on the whole, a wild
tangled mass of trunks and branches, bound together by countless
ropes of creeping bamboo and thorny rattan.</p>

<p>Cutting right and left, avoiding a thick bush here and a hanging
screen of creepers there, perspiring at every step, we forced a
sinuous way in from the beach, until, coming upon a well-trodden
pig-track, we found progress so much easier, that, with a little
chopping now and again, we were able to move about with some
degree of freedom, and along the path so slowly made, a long line
of traps was set and baited in readiness for night.</p>

<p>Such a performance is one that regularly occurs during the
first visit to each fresh locality in which one collects, and on
these occasions the noise caused by chopping away branches and
crashing through the bushes very naturally makes the denizens of
the jungle conspicuous by their absence.</p>

<p>Afterwards, however, as you move quietly along the path, with
all the faculties freely given to the detection of those various
objects to the desire for possession of which your presence is
due, the jungle seems a much less lonely place, and after days
spent in wandering in its shade, during which a bit more path<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
has been cut here, and a few more yards of open space added
there, you find that you can take quite a long walk, entirely
uninterrupted by use of the <i>parang</i> hanging at your side.</p>

<p>Among the few birds shot that first afternoon were the
beautiful Andamanese oriole, with gorgeous plumage of black and
yellow, and a peculiar cuckoo&mdash;<i>Centropus andamanensis</i>&mdash;soberly
clad in brown and grey. This bird was a source of much disappointment
on one occasion. There are no squirrels known to
the Andamans, and seeing what I took for one, without waiting,
in the momentary excitement of an apparently fresh discovery, to
look more closely, I made a rapid snap-shot, and down tumbled
a cuckoo; my consequent disgust may be imagined. The bird,
however, can easily be mistaken for a small mammal, for besides
resembling one, with its dark brown plumage and fairly long tail,
its habit is to spring from bough to bough and creep along the
branches in a very rodent-like manner.</p>

<p>Warned by the fading daylight, we returned to the shore, and
found a quarter of a mile of dry coral between ourselves and the
water, with the dinghy high and dry, so, after making it fast to
the mangroves, we picked a way across the reef and hailed the
schooner for another boat.</p>

<p>These coral-reefs, although their beauty of form and colour&mdash;an
endless change of myriad shapes and tints&mdash;when seen through
the clear water from a boat above is quite beyond description,
awaken far less admiration when they have to be crossed on foot
while the tide is low. It is impossible for even natives to cross
them barefooted. Nearest the shore comes first a belt of mud
and coral <i>d&eacute;bris</i> that is easily traversed; next lies a broad strip of
sharp and brittle madrepores which break and crumble beneath
one's weight; while, seaward, rise from deep water the Astr&aelig;as&mdash;great
solid masses of which the reefs are mostly built; and as one
jumps from mound to mound, one vaguely wonders at which of
those in front a slip may occur, and as the least result plunge
one head over heels into the pools around. With a small boat,
however, shallow and quick-turning, it is generally possible to pass
through these latter and reach a point, where, protected by boots,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the shore may be attained at the slight expense of a wetting below
the knees.</p>

<p>To escape this unpleasant little journey, we moved a day
or two later farther up the strait to where the shore was free
from coral, and therefore more accessible, although having
reached it, we were confronted by a precipitous cliff of
crumbling earth, but when the top was gained, after a zigzag
climb, we moved on level ground covered with heavy
jungle.</p>

<p>The smaller species of birds were very rare here, but we
got almost immediately the first specimen of the island parrots&mdash;the
brilliant green <i>Pal&aelig;ornis magnirostris</i>. This bird is the
local representative of a continental form, from which it differs
only in the enormous size of the bill, which in the male is
of bright scarlet.</p>

<p>It is a somewhat callous thing to attempt to do, but should
one succeed in only severely wounding a parrot, others of the
species are sure to be obtained. The cries of the injured
bird so attract its companions that they will gather near from
all parts within hearing, and seem so possessed with curiosity
to know what is wrong, as to be, for the time, perfectly oblivious
of the collector and his gun, while they sit around or fly nearer
and nearer to their wounded companion and answer its loud
croaking notes with others equally harsh.</p>

<p>Parrots of three species were very numerous, and perhaps
the most frequent noise in the jungle was their shrill scream,
uttered as they flew from tree to tree. Many big black crows,
too, flopped&mdash;a word which exactly describes their movement&mdash;noisily
about, and, when hidden by a screen of leaves, we
mimicked their cawing notes, more bewildered birds it would
be difficult to find. In these woods the larger birds were
fairly common, and the traps obtained for us numerous rats of
two varieties, one of which squealed pitifully when approached
(<i>Mus stoicus</i>, sp. nov., and <i>M. flebilis</i>, sp. nov.).</p>

<p>The Archipelago is inhabited by a tribe known as Aka-Balawa,
now on the verge of extinction, as it numbers only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
twenty individuals; but the sole traces of occupation we came
across were the decayed remains of a canoe, lying up one of
the mangrove creeks that branch off from the strait.</p>

<p>We remained here three days, all that could be spared from
the time given to the cruise, and early on January 11th left for
Port Blair.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>PORT BLAIR</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">We enter the Harbour&mdash;Surveillance&mdash;Ross Island Pastimes&mdash;Visit the Chief
Commissioner&mdash;The Harbour&mdash;Cellular Jail&mdash;Lime Kilns&mdash;Ph&#339;nix Bay&mdash;Hopetown&mdash;Murder
of Lord Mayo&mdash;Chatham Island&mdash;Haddo and the
Andamanese&mdash;Tea Gardens&mdash;Viper Island and Jail&mdash;The Convicts&mdash;Occupations&mdash;Punishments&mdash;Troops&mdash;Departure.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">A fresh</span> breeze from the north raised an army of dancing
white-caps on the sea, as, rolling along with the wind astern, we
made the run to Port Blair in about seven hours.</p>

<p>Easily picking up the Settlement while some distance off, on
account of its proximity to Mount Harriet&mdash;a pointed hill rising
about 1200 feet&mdash;we came to anchor to the south of the jetty inside
Ross Island, and were immediately boarded by one of the native
police&mdash;a representative of which body was always on board
during the day throughout our stay. This measure is taken to
see that the crews of vessels in the harbour hold no communication
with the convicts, and also for the prevention of smuggling.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the doctor and port officer came aboard:
both these gentlemen seemed at first to regard us with some
suspicion, and indeed by this time, more than two months out
from port, we were certainly a rather ruffianly looking party.</p>

<p>The island of Ross is situated at the mouth of the harbour,
and tends greatly towards its protection. It is hilly, about 200
acres in area, and is divided into two almost equal parts by a wall
running east and west across it; the southern portion is occupied
by the barracks of the convicts, and the other contains the headquarters
of the Settlement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>On the summit stands the pleasant-looking residence of the
Chief Commissioner; the church, and the barracks (architecturally
modelled on Windsor Castle) for European troops; both the latter
built of a handsome brown stone quarried on the mainland.
Below these come the mess, containing a fine library and some
beautiful examples of wood-carving executed by Burmese convicts;
then the brown-roofed bungalows of the Settlement officers, all
bowered in tropic foliage, amongst which graceful palms and
traveller's trees stand prominently forth; and lower still, near the
sea, are the treasury, commissariat stores, and other Government
buildings. The whole place&mdash;in itself of much natural beauty&mdash;is
kept in most perfect condition by a practically unlimited supply
of convict labour.</p>

<p>At first sight, it seemed an altogether delightful spot to find
in such an isolated corner of the earth; but its melancholy aspect
is quickly and forcibly brought home to one by a visit to the jail
on Viper Island, and by the continuous presence of the convicts,
who are rendered conspicuous by their fetters, or neck-rings,
supporting the numbered badges by which the wearers are
distinguished.</p>

<p>As usual with our countrymen, "when two or three are
gathered together" in distant portions of the world, plentiful facilities
for outdoor amusements have come into being. There are cricket
and tennis grounds&mdash;the latter both concrete and grass&mdash;near
which a band of convicts discourses very fair music several times
a week. There is a sailing club too, and nearly every Saturday
throughout the year races for a challenge cup are held in the
breezy harbour, at which a score of various craft are often found
competing; and the Volunteer Rifle Corps has some thirty
members, who compete with gun and revolver for a numerous
list of prizes and trophies. Good salt-water fishing is to be had
with the rod, for fish in great variety are everywhere abundant;
and on the mainland, near Aberdeen, golf and hockey are
played.</p>

<span class="caption">ROSS ISLAND (northern extremity).</span>
</div>

<p>With all this, it is probable that the gentler sex find things
somewhat dull at times, for shopping, in the feminine sense of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the word, is impossible. There are no shops, and the wants of
the community are supplied by a co-operative store, at which,
it is reported, in more than one year recently, articles have
been sold at a price considerably under cost. Besides this, there
is only the native bazaar, which is, of course, ubiquitous in
the East.</p>

<p>Before visiting the Nicobars, it is necessary for all vessels
to obtain a permit, so, in duty bound, we called one morning
on the Chief Commissioner, and to him we are indebted for much
information that became valuable in the next few months.</p>

<p>Colonel Temple, who takes much interest in the natives of
his district, particularly from a philological standpoint, possesses
a very complete ethnological collection of Andamanese and
Nicobarese articles, and an aviary containing a great number of
the birds inhabiting the two groups of islands. All these objects
we were fortunate enough to see, and so gained at the outset
a very good idea of those things we were so anxious to obtain
specimens of for ourselves.</p>

<p>One morning, in the company of Mr P. Vaux, acting port
officer, we made a delightful tour round the harbour in one
of the Government launches.</p>

<p>Port Blair is a long, ragged indentation, about seven miles
from head to mouth, broken and diversified by numerous little
bays and promontories. The shores&mdash;intersected by numerous
roads&mdash;are almost entirely cleared from jungle, and since they
have been in this condition, fever has been practically unknown
amongst the European community.</p>

<p>Passing first close by the suburb of Aberdeen, which is on
the mainland just opposite Ross, we obtained a good view of
the Cellular Jail, a huge building of red-brown bricks, with long
arms&mdash;three storeys in height&mdash;stretching from a common centre
like the rays of a starfish. It has been built almost entirely
from local resources, and with local establishment and labour,
and holds 663 cells and the accompanying jail buildings. Here
each newcomer is incarcerated in solitude for six months, with
the double intention of such confinement acting both as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
moral sedative and a warning of what may happen again if
his behaviour is not satisfactory in future.</p>

<p>We steamed along past the brickfields; the kilns, where,
from the raw coral, lime is manufactured; but as the salt cannot
be thoroughly washed out, and subsequently effloresces from the
mortar, the result is a rather inferior quality.</p>

<p>At Ph&#339;nix Bay, a little farther up the harbour, where we
landed to inspect the shipyard and workshops, are sheds fitted
up with apparatus for blacksmiths and latheworkers, carpenters
and woodcarvers, where occupation is provided for more than
600 skilled workmen. The numerous boats one sees passing
to and fro in the harbour are built here, for the shipyard can
undertake anything from a 250-ton lighter or 70-feet steam-launch
down to a half&mdash;rater or the smallest dinghy. The
materials for construction are close to hand, since the woods
used (<i>padouk</i> for the planking and <i>pyimma</i> for frames)
are obtained from the neighbouring forests.</p>

<p>Some years ago Ph&#339;nix Bay was a swamp, but now large,
brick, steam workshops and wooden sheds of the marine yard,
in which the lighters and launches are constructed and repaired,
stand on the land reclaimed; and connected with these is a
slipway, one of the largest in India, that is entirely of local
construction&mdash;the whole of the ironwork of the carriage, rails,
wheels, and ratchet, having been cast on the spot.</p>

<p>Almost opposite Ph&#339;nix Bay, the station of Hopetown,
conspicuous by its aqueduct, stands on the northern shore. It
was here that in 1872 Lord Mayo, the most popular of Indian
Viceroys, was murdered by a fanatical prisoner.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 572px;">
<img src="images/fp022.jpg" width="572" height="440" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">ANDAMANESE MEN.</span>
</div>

<p>The Viceroy had visited Mount Harriet in order to judge
of its suitability as a sanatorium, and had just finished the
descent. "... The ships' bells had just rung seven; the
launch, with steam up, was whizzing at the jetty stairs; a group
of her seamen were chatting on the pierhead. It was now
quite dark, and the black line of the jungle seemed to touch
the water's edge. The party passed some large loose stones to
the left of the head of the pier, and advanced along the jetty,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
two torchbearers in front ... and the Viceroy stepped quickly
forward before the rest to descend the stairs to the launch. The
next moment the people in the rear heard a noise, as of 'the
rush of some animal,' from behind the loose stones; one or
two saw a hand and a knife suddenly descend in the torch-light.
The private secretary heard a thud, and instantly turning
round, found a man 'fastened like a tiger' on the back of the
Viceroy. In a second, twelve men were on the assassin; an
English officer was pulling them off, and with his sword hilt
keeping back the native guards, who would have killed the
assailant on the spot. The torches had gone out; but the
Viceroy, who had staggered over the pier side, was dimly seen
rising up in the knee-deep water and clearing the hair off his
brow with his hand, as if recovering himself.  His private
secretary was instantly by his side in the surf, helping him up
the bank. 'Burne,' he said quietly, 'they've hit me.'
Then in a louder voice, which was heard on the pier&mdash;'I'm
all right, I don't think I'm much hurt,' or words to that effect.
In another minute he was sitting under the smoky glare of
the re-lit torches, on a rude native cart at the side of the
jetty, his legs hanging loosely down. Then they lifted him
bodily out of the cart, and saw a great dark patch on the
back of his light coat. The blood came streaming out, and the
men tried to stanch it with their handkerchiefs. For a moment
or two he sat up in the cart, then he fell heavily backwards.
'Lift up my head,' he said faintly; and said no more."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Leaving Ph&#339;nix Bay, we steamed past Chatham Island,
where the sawmills are situated, and where a number of hospital
convalescents are kept busy with the easy task of manufacturing
rope and mats from the coir prepared in Viper Jail. On the
approach of a hurricane, vessels in port proceed up harbour and
anchor above this island, where they are secure from all danger.</p>

<p>Our next stopping-place was at Haddo, where we visited the
Andamanese in their Homes, and out on the water saw a number
of natives fishing from canoes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>The sheds in which the aborigines are domiciled are substantial
structures of attap, standing near the sea in the shade of coco palms.
We found present eight or nine women, and twice that number of
men and boys, who, on catching sight of our advance, ran out of
doors to meet us. Two or three babies present were carried by
the mothers in a broad band suspended from forehead or shoulder.
The first thought that flashed into one's mind on perceiving them,
with their small stature, sooty skins, and frizzly hair, was that here
were a number of juvenile negroes ("niggers"): they are, however,
far better-looking than that people, and some of the women might
almost be called pretty, even when judged from a European
standpoint.</p>

<p>For clothing, the men wore breech-clouts of red cotton, and
strings of beads or small shells about the neck: the ornaments of
the women consisted of similar necklaces, and several girdles of
beads or bark, in the lowest of which a green leaf was inserted, by
way of apron. The hair of the women was slightly shorter than the
men's, but worn in a similar fashion&mdash;all but a circular patch on
the top of the head, like a skull-cap, was shaved away, and this was
often divided by a broad band of bare skin running from back to
front. Chest and back were covered with skin decoration of the
cicatrice type, which, healing without any tendency to keloid, left a
smooth mark, distinguished by its lustre only from the normal
surface. Many had smeared themselves with fat, which gave the
skin a very shiny appearance.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 557px;">
<img src="images/fp024.jpg" width="557" height="424" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">ANDAMANESE WOMEN.</span>
</div>

<p>The bows carried were of the recurved paddle type that attains
its greatest development in the Andamans,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and the arrows were
armed with formidable iron points and barbs: the heads of these
are detachable, and are connected with a shaft by a short cord of
fibre, which is wound about the arrow by twisting the head in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
socket. These arrows are used in shooting pig, and of course
much impede the escape of any animal, by the shaft disengaging
from the head and catching in the undergrowth of the jungle.
The bows were constructed of white wood, and handled with
the recurved end downward.</p>

<p>The foreheads of some of the women were daubed with white
clay, and one, in addition to a quantity of coral ornaments, wore
suspended from her neck a human skull daubed with red earth.
This, however, is not, as was long supposed, a sign of conjugal
mourning, for any of the relatives or intimate friends of a deceased
person are qualified to wear his disinterred bones, and the skull
often passes round amongst a considerable number of people.</p>

<p>We were agreeably surprised at the appearance of the
natives, as they were clean, pleasant-looking, and merry,
apparently somewhat childish in disposition, and much given
to chatter and laughter.</p>

<p>On leaving, we flung a number of small coins amongst them,
and these were scrambled for with great noise and excitement.</p>

<p>The Homes are occupied from time to time only by the
natives, who are allowed to go and come as they please, and
while dwelling in them are supplied with provisions. Love of
the jungle, and the life to which they are born, is so deeply
rooted in the aborigines, that although they occupy the sheds
intermittently for varying periods, few have been found who
are sufficiently attracted by the neighbouring civilisation to
become permanent residents.</p>

<p>As we proceeded up the harbour we caught a glimpse, at
the head of Navy Bay, of the tea gardens which have for some
time been established there. The product is very coarse and
strong, and finds favour with the European troops in India,
and with the Madras Army.</p>

<p>Lastly we came to Viper Island, which has been not inappropriately
christened "Hell," for in Viper Jail are kept the
very worst of the prisoners in the Settlement, and it must
not be forgotten that here are collected the scum of the whole
immense Indian Empire and of Burma as well. No one is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
sent to the islands who has less than seven years to serve, and
many here, perhaps, are those, who, but for some flaw in the
evidence which convicted them, might long ago have paid the
last penalty for their crimes.</p>

<p>Viper Island is elevated in parts with a somewhat broken
surface, and the Jail, with its grey-and-white walls, standing
among a group of trees, shows picturesquely from the summit
of a hill. A number of convicts are confined to the island,
besides those in the prison, and to accommodate them barracks
have been erected in various spots.</p>

<p>We landed on a jetty, and, passing by the guardhouse at its
foot, soon climbed the little hill, on the top of which the prison
is situated. First, and grimmest sight of all, came the condemned
cells and the gallows, and then we passed&mdash;accompanied
by a guard of police&mdash;through room after room full of men
reclining on slabs of masonry. The shackled inmates of these
wards, who rose unwillingly with clanking irons at the word of
command, are under the control of promoted convicts made
responsible for their behaviour. The effect of our entrance
varied with different individuals; some, apparently apathetic
and sullen, took no notice whatever, while others seemed to
evince the liveliest curiosity.</p>

<p>As the day of our visit was a Sunday, no work was being
done: all the inmates were undisturbed, save a few whose heads
were being cropped, and some convalescents receiving their
midday ration&mdash;a <i>chap&aacute;t&iacute;</i>, and an ample portion of coarse
boiled rice.</p>

<p>The scope allowed for employment in the prison is somewhat
limited, for, while the work must be of sufficient severity to act
as a punishment, it must of necessity be of such a nature that
the tools accessory to it are not of a kind that can be used by
those handling them in an attack on jailers or fellow-prisoners.
Among the tasks set are coir-pounding, in which a certain
quantity must be produced and made into bundles every day:
the heavy mallets used are fastened, for safety, by a short
lanyard to the beam on which the husk is broken up. Again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
oil has to be expressed from a given weight of <i>copra</i> by pounding
the material in iron mortars with unwieldy wooden pestles.
Wool-teasing is yet another form of occupation.</p>

<p>Besides the wards, there are a number of cells for solitary
confinement; some of these were occupied by prisoners suspected
of malingering, others by those awaiting punishment.</p>

<p>This last, of course, takes various forms, from&mdash;for instance&mdash;the
dark cell, where an offender may be incarcerated for twenty-four
hours, to castigation with a rattan, in which, it is said,
the maximum sentence of thirty strokes can be applied so severely
as to be fatal to the recipient. Lastly, of course, comes execution
by hanging, which is inflicted in the case of those prisoners, who,
being already under severe sentence, attempt the lives of their
fellows, their warders, or the officials of the Settlement.</p>

<p>The transportation of European offenders is now discontinued,
but a large number of female convicts are engaged mainly in
turning the wool prepared in Viper Jail into blankets.</p>

<p>Caste&mdash;a most important point in connection with people of
India&mdash;is carefully respected, and the Brahmin prisoners are nearly
all employed as cooks.</p>

<p>The majority of the convicts are from the Indian Peninsula, and
are resident for life. Of the Burmese, however, the greater part
are serving sentences of ten years, for engaging too recklessly
in the national pastime of dacoity, and many of them are
employed in the jungle and as boatmen.</p>

<p>To maintain discipline, and for the protection of the Settlement,
a military force of about 440 men is stationed at Aberdeen,
Ross, and Viper&mdash;two companies of European and four of
native troops&mdash;and a battalion of military police.</p>

<p>After leaving Viper Island we returned to the headquarters
of the Settlement, where next day we left behind the last post
of civilisation met with, until three months later we reached
Olehleh, the most northerly of the Dutch colonies in Acheen.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving Port Blair, where we got up anchor at half-past
three in the morning to make the most of a light breeze, we
sailed slowly along the coast of South Andaman, until, rounding
the point of the south-east corner, we came to anchor in
Macpherson Strait.</p>

<p>Just outside the port we met the R.I.M.S. <i>Elphinstone</i>
returning from a census-taking visit to the Nicobars; three or
four times a year she makes a ten days' trip round the group,
stopping at a few of the more important places; and these
cruises are almost the only thing that brings home to the
natives the fact that they are under the British raj.</p>

<p>For some distance south of the Settlement the land consists
of undulating grassy hills, dotted with coco palms, and streaked
by gullies, in which dark clumps of jungle still remain. It is
an ideal country for game, and some years ago hog-deer were
introduced; but, although they have multiplied, they are very
rarely seen, and have afforded but little sport.</p>

<p>Nearer the strait, the hills by the coast are still covered with
forest; and between the stretches of sandy shore at their feet
grow luxuriant thickets of mangroves.</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 569px;">
<img src="images/fp028.jpg" width="569" height="422" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">ANDAMANESE SHELTER.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>Rutland Island, rising on the east in tall precipitous cliffs,
on the north slopes gently to the strait, which on both sides
is bordered by alternate tracts of yellow beach and bright
green mangrove.</p>

<p>We hauled round Bird's Nest Cape&mdash;a bare rocky headland
of serpentine, still producing those edible delicacies which are
responsible for the name&mdash;and, with a man aloft to con a
passage along the coral-reef, carefully avoided a rock near mid-channel,
and took up a berth in quiet waters about a mile from
the entrance of the strait.</p>

<p>When sailing along little known shores, especially in the
tropics, a look-out man should always be stationed at the
masthead, for from that place dangers of reef and rock
unnoticed from the deck are plainly visible. Year by year
coral-reefs increase, and banks alter so greatly that entire
reliance cannot be placed on the chart, even though it be of
comparatively recent date.</p>

<p>We landed on South Andaman in a little bay, whose waters
lapped a beach of golden sand. It was, as usual, nearly filled
with coral, but fortunately the tide was never so low that we
could not land directly on the shore. To left and right the
land rose in gentle hills, on the one hand forest, and on the
other grass-clothed, but beyond the centre, where it was flat,
lay an expanse of tangled swamp.</p>

<p>Although their tracks, made since the last high tide, ran
all along the beach, we saw no natives then or later; but just
within the bush we found an old camping-place&mdash;cold ashes,
heaps of broken shells, and a dilapidated hut about 6 feet
square and high, made of light branches stuck in the ground,
with tops drawn together and covered with a few palm leaves
laid stem downwards.</p>

<p>That night a fire shone brightly on the beach of Rutland
Island; and so next morning, while Abbott in the dinghy went
north to make the round of the traps, I, with a crew in the
whaleboat, rowed across the strait, and when we were within two
or three hundred yards of the shore, a tall native ran down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
beach and commenced waving a flag on the end of a long
pole.</p>

<p>As the sea was pounding heavily on the reef, a couple of
men were left in the boat to keep it off shore, and the rest of
us, jumping overboard, waded to the beach. Two or three
other natives now arrived, and we showed our good intentions
by slapping them on their backs, with broad grins, to the latter
part of which process they responded most heartily.</p>

<p>It was too early in the day to get to work with the camera,
so, after fetching my gun from the boat, I struck into the
jungle and spent an hour with the more clothed of its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>The jungle was of the kind that may perhaps be best
described as forest: that is to say, it was fairly free from the
usual superabundance of rattans, lianas, and all those creeping
growths which close the intervals among the trees with a thorny
network of vegetation, and compel the intruder to go where
he can and not where he will. Mighty trees towered upwards,
branches interlacing and shutting out the sun, while down
below, in the aisles of tree-trunks, stood the smaller brethren
and the saplings, waiting the fall of some neighbouring giant to
give them in turn room to lift their branches towards the
light.</p>

<p>Little blue fly-catchers, utterly fearless, flitted about in the
lower bushes, and, higher up, golden-billed grackles hopped
or flew from branch to branch, their loud clear whistles resounding
through the forest, whilst from the tops of the biggest trees
came the deep "boom, boom," of the great fruit-pigeons. However,
although birds were fairly numerous, I got but few prizes&mdash;best
among them, perhaps, a pretty little olive-green and yellow
minivet (<i>Pericrocrotus andamanensis</i>), and a black racquet-tailed
drongo (<i>Dissemuroides andamanensis</i>), a bird whose flight, as
its long tail feathers stretch out behind, is extremely graceful,
and who possessed one of the sweetest combination of notes
heard in the jungle.</p>

<p>With such specimens in my bag, I presently came on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
little stream, and after following its course to the sea, tramped
along the shore, and so came back once more to the boat.</p>

<p>A large fire had been made on the beach, and near it,
in spite of the hot sun, the men sat fraternising with the
members of the native party&mdash;five men and boys, three women,
and three children.</p>

<p>In this little company there proved to be the three biggest
men we saw among the Andamanese; in height, they stood 5 feet
4&frac34; inches, 5 feet 3&frac14; inches, and 5 feet 2 inches respectively.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
Although possibly a little weak proportionately in the legs,
where the skin covering the knee was so thickened and corrugated
as to almost resemble callosities, the members of
the party were well built and not ungraceful, but spoilt in
most cases by a varying degree of distension of the abdomen:
this state of things is caused by the immense amount of food
they will, when possible, consume at a sitting; but the striking
appearance of the eldest matron of the tribe was a more or
less temporary feature, principally due to the interesting condition
in which she was.</p>

<p>It was a pleasure to photograph these people, for they submitted
to the operation most docilely; and when, after taking
a series of pictures, I gave a graphic invitation to breakfast&mdash;pointing
to my mouth, and rubbing that portion of the figure
situated in the middle front&mdash;the men of the party all accepted
the offer, and, reinforced by them, we returned to the <i>Terrapin</i>.</p>

<p>Arrived on board, they were at first rather inquisitive, but
after inspecting the schooner and spending a little time below
watching us at work, they went forward, and seemed quite
comfortable amongst the men. As soon as it could be prepared,
a large pailful of boiled rice was placed before them,
and this was finished without any sign of flagging being shown.
What a convenience the absence of tight clothing must be at
such times!</p>

<p>The next few hours were passed by them lying on deck
in the sun, where, out of regard for their feelings, we left them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
undisturbed, except for the few moments during which they
were measured. To a second bucket of rice, offered before
they left, they failed to do proper justice, but took what
remained ashore, where the women probably had their
share.</p>

<p>We ran across the strait under canvas, before a light breeze,
and the sail was a source of huge amusement to all but the
youngest of the party, who was intermittently busied in returning
to daylight all the food he had previously consumed.</p>

<p>Following what seems a wide-spread custom, the ladies
ashore, had, to some extent, got themselves up for the reception
of visitors. Although the previous dress&mdash;a small bunch of grass
slung from the waist by a cord&mdash;fulfilled all requirements,
they were now further decorated with an almost complete coating
of ochreous clay, through which black eyes, nose, and lips
showed below a bald pate with ludicrous effect. The babies,
too, had been glorified in the same manner, and we felt quite
bashful and shabby in our old pyjamas.</p>

<p>So absurdly comical did they appear, that it was only by
much perseverance I was able to photograph them again, for
whenever I attempted to adjust the focus, the picture on the
screen gave rise to such fits of laughter that the camera was
in danger of being upset. Even the boat's crew, unemotional
Malays as they were, lay about, doubled up in paroxysms of
laughter, which, increased by the looks of wonder and the
ingenuous smiles with which my subjects persisted in regarding
us, continued until the point of sheer exhaustion was reached.
The old lady of the party and myself became great friends, and
when on our departure I presented her with my handkerchief
(all that I then had left) as a souvenir of our visit&mdash;as I
gravely tied it about her head, I am sure we made an impressive
picture.</p>

<p>The huts, or <i>ch&aacute;ng</i>, were four in number, and stood side
by side just within the jungle, with the fronts facing inland.
On a sloping framework of thin branches, raised about 4 feet
at the upper edge, and covering a piece of ground 6 feet square,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were laid sufficient palm leaves to make a rain-proof shelter.
The front and sides were left completely unprotected, the
earth below was covered with more palm leaves, and a small
fire was burning on the ground below an upper corner of each
roof.</p>

<p>The only food they appeared to be supplied with was
obtained from the large trees beneath which the camp stood&mdash;a
small round fruit with a green skin, and a pleasantly-flavoured
pulpy flesh; a large quantity of dark-coloured beeswax was
lying about, so honey was probably plentiful and easily
obtained.</p>

<p>By signs, we gave the men to understand that we wished
to purchase bows and arrows, and while these were being
produced from some hiding-place in the jungle, whither the
natives requested us not to accompany them, the women and
children regaled themselves with a parcel of sugar which had
been brought for their special benefit.</p>

<p>We eagerly bought up all visible belongings that could
be carried off. Among these were small pots made from the
joints of the giant bamboo, conical baskets of rattan fibre, and
large buckets carved from solid wood, any cracks being sewn
up with rattan and luted with wax; all these were furnished
with slings for ease in carrying.</p>

<p>The bows were not of the kind regarded as typical of the
Andamanese, but are fashioned in the style to which we are
accustomed at home, with this peculiarity&mdash;that instead of the
rounded side or "belly" being nearest the string, it is away
from the archer when the weapon is held ready for use. They
are about 5 feet long, and of a material resembling rosewood;
the tips are cut away, so as to leave a shoulder for the string
to rest on, and below these points the bow is whipped for an
inch with fine cord. The string is of twisted fibre, with a loop
at either end, made by taking a half-hitch and then twisting
in the loose end for a short distance.</p>

<p>Arrows have the shaft of bamboo, to which is attached a
long point of hard wood, and the joint is whipped. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the arrows used for fishing are triple-headed. A fairly
deep notch is made to receive the bowstring, and the butt of
the arrow is tightly scored transversely, with the idea of affording
a better grip. The lengths varied from 45 to 66 inches.</p>

<p>While being strung, the bow is held almost vertically, with
one end resting on the ground. A foot is then placed on the
centre, and the upper end drawn towards the operator until the
loop can be slipped over it.</p>

<p>The pull used may be anything between 50 and 60 lbs., and
though in the jungle, with their silent step and quality of
remaining unseen, the Andamanese are dangerous as enemies,
in the open they would be less formidable, for it is doubtful
whether their arrows will carry more than a hundred yards,
and certainly their shooting, as we ourselves saw, possessed
little accuracy at more than a quarter of that distance.</p>

<p>In return for the various articles obtained, we gave an axe,
a <i>parang</i>, a file, a number of long French nails, and a quantity
of red cotton, with which things they seemed very satisfied; and
we left behind, as a parting gift, a good supply of rice and
leaf tobacco.</p>

<p>The dress of the women I have already described: their
heads were bald, entirely shaved of hair. The men were only
partially cropped, and what hair was left was short, and had
much the appearance of a small skull-cap. Those who were
ornamented with clay had applied it in long stripes down arms
and body, and across the face, while for further decoration
some wore a cord about the waist, or armlets of fibre tightly
fastened round the biceps.</p>

<p>We found the shores of South Andaman a splendid locality
for collecting. One morning in particular I remember. On
landing we saw all about the beach the tracks of numerous pigs
that had come down in the night to obtain a meal of the trepang,
crabs, and molluscs left exposed by the ebb tide; and I had
not been five minutes ashore before I knocked over an equal
number of beautiful parrots (<i>P. faciatus</i>), a species we found
everywhere very common throughout the Andamans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>A little group of coco palms, in a corner of the bay, marks
a spring from which we obtained good water, and adjacent stood
a small leafless tree, whose branches, however, bore quantities
of a brilliant red blossom (<i>Ixora</i>, sp.?). To this came birds
in such numbers that I remained beneath it all the morning.
Here I obtained our first specimens of the Andaman sun-bird,
a tiny thing with olive back, blue throat, and yellow breast,
and also one of the most beautiful of kingfishers (<i>Halcyon saturatior</i>),
a glorious combination of bright chestnut, white, and
vivid blues that one could never tire of admiring. Common
was the little crested bulbul, clothed in black and white, with
crimson ear-coverts, and equally so the brilliant-plumaged oriole,
while the sleek-looking Andaman myna, soberly feathered in
black and white, occurred in no small numbers. Indeed, birds
came and went so quickly, that I was often hard put to it to
select the proper cartridge, and frequently three or four specimens
at a time lay waiting to be stowed away in the game
bag.</p>

<p>Time and place combined to make a naturalist's paradise,
and I did not desist from collecting until my stock of
wool, paper, and ammunition were exhausted. It must not
be thought, however, that such an experience is in any way
common, for it is seldom that the work is so easy or the
harvest so large.</p>

<p>Amongst the birds obtained on South Andaman was a
pigeon that has since proved to be new (<i>Osmotreron</i>, sp. nov.);
while, as far as mammals were concerned, rats of two species&mdash;one
hitherto unrecorded, <i>Mus taciturnus</i>, sp. nov., and <i>M.
andamanensis</i>&mdash;were fairly common; and we were fortunate
in obtaining a palm-civet, of the species peculiar to the islands,
which for several nights had been committing depredations
along the line of traps; and also a single example of a new
shrew (<i>Crocidura andamanensis</i>).</p>

Pig&mdash;We leave the Andamans.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> channel that separates Rutland Island from Little
Andaman is about 28 miles wide, and is everywhere less
than 50 fathoms in depth. Several small wooded islets rise
above its shallow waters, leaving in the centre, however, a
clear stretch of sea&mdash;the Duncan Passage&mdash;which is sometimes
traversed by ships passing through the Archipelago.</p>

<p>At the northernmost group of these islets, the Cinques,
we spent a day, before visiting the coast of Little Andaman.
The two islands, which are narrow and hilly, stretch for about
6 miles in an almost N. and S. direction, and are almost joined
by a reef of rocks awash at high tide; they are only 3 miles
distant from the south-east end of Rutland Island, and 9 miles
from Macpherson Strait. We anchored between the islands,
in a little bay in the shore of the northernmost, with the
reef of rocks to the eastward.</p>

<p>Here, as in all such islands where there are no streams or
mangrove swamps, the water was excessively clear&mdash;so clear that
we could perceive fish swimming amongst the coral, and the
anchor lying on the bottom 10 fathoms below.</p>

<p>The forest on the southern and western shores presents a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
striking contrast to the jungle of the other islands, and bears
witness to the strength of the south-west monsoon. The
slopes of the hills are scantily covered with grass, and on the
lower ground, amongst the starved and twisted trees, numerous
dead branches show white against the scanty foliage of the
other wind-warped limbs. Below, the effect is stranger still,
for the shrubs and bushes grow in rows running inland from
the beach, so that one can walk up and down between them
as in the lines of an artificial plantation.</p>

<p>The beach on which we landed was composed entirely of
white coral sand, and upon it we found graceful branches of
a brown and white coralline (<i>Isis hippurus</i>), and numbers of
pearly-chambered spirulas. After forcing a way through the
matted foliage, we reached the more protected parts of the
island, where the jungle was of a more luxuriant description;
but animal life was very scarce everywhere, and our list of
the avifauna contains the names of ten species only.</p>

<p>There are no permanent inhabitants, but the Cinques are
occasionally visited by the natives (&Ouml;ng&eacute;s of Little Andaman
and natives from Port Blair), who probably find it a good
locality for turtle and fish. We picked up in the jungle
an arrow of a kind afterwards obtained at Little Andaman,
and discovered a path that ran from south to north, where,
on the shore of a little sandy cove, stood a hut similar to
those already seen, save that sides had been added, thus making
a semicircular shelter, and a small platform of sticks erected
above the fireplace. A number of baskets hung from the roof, and
for flooring, instead of palm leaves, there was an old teak grating
and some planks&mdash;flotsam, perhaps, from a shipwrecked vessel.</p>

<p>At midnight a fair breeze sprang up and we made sail,
crawling slowly southward by its help, until, twelve hours later,
we dropped anchor off the coast of Little Andaman.</p>

<p>Eyubelong, as it is called by its inhabitants, the &Ouml;ng&eacute;s&mdash;a
tribe, who, by their bows, absence of scarification, and other
indications, seem to be closely akin to the Jarawas&mdash;is in shape
an irregular ellipse, with an area of rather more than 250 square<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
miles, and a level verdure-clad surface that rises gradually to a
height of 600 feet in the interior towards the south. It has
no harbour on its coasts, but on the northern shores two or
three creeks run inland for short distances. We brought up
off the northern of these, by name Bumila, which seemed to
offer a well-protected anchorage; but when the boat was sent
off with a sounding-line to make observations, we found that
coral reefs, stretching from either side, so narrowed and complicated
the entrance that it would be a task of some difficulty
to take the schooner in, and one still more so to get her out,
against the prevailing breeze. The lead, too, at low tide, gave
the greatest depth as 8 feet, and even in the channel large
coral heads rose irregularly from the bottom: it was, therefore,
decided that we should make a short stay only, and that during
it the <i>Terrapin</i> should remain outside.</p>

<p>Already a group of natives had gathered on the beach, all
waving bunches of leaves, and since we had been warned that
all the tribes but those at the north end were still hostile, we
concluded that this particular band were displaying that token
of friendship common to nearly all savages&mdash;the green branch
of a tree. Very soon, however, we found that the waving
leaves were for a far more practical purpose, and that the creek
thoroughly deserved its name. Bumila is S. Andamanese for
"fly," and I don't think I ever saw so many of those pestiferous
insects together at one time. They swarmed round the natives
and settled on their naked bodies in hundreds, and no sooner
had we landed than we were assailed in so impartial a fashion
that we quickly followed the example of the inhabitants and
supplied ourselves with defensive branches.</p>

<p>The Andamanese were quite friendly&mdash;although they are
said to be treacherous and scarcely to be trusted in the south-western
portion of the island&mdash;so, after a short survey of the
creek, we returned to the <i>Terrapin</i>, accompanied by a legion of
flies, together with as many natives as the boat would hold,
and the latter were soon at work on as hearty a meal as that
made by their countrymen at Rutland Island. The party met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
at Rutland Island were also &Ouml;ng&eacute;s and were merely visiting
Rutland Island on their way to or from Port Blair.</p>

<p>By the time we landed again in the afternoon, the number
of waiting natives had increased to about thirty, and they
continued to arrive until between sixty and seventy were present,
of all ages and both sexes.</p>

<p>One of our party, who stands some inches over 6 feet
in his socks, and is proportionately built, was a contrast to
a group of natives, none of whom were more than 5 feet
in height; and nothing impressed my mind more forcibly
than this sight with the racial diminutiveness of the Negrito
race.</p>

<p>By way of ornament, the men rang the changes on chaplets
and armlets made from the inner bark of a tree, and necklaces
and girdles of cord, in which was twisted some bright yellow
material of a straw-like nature. Similar ornaments were worn
by the women, who, in addition, wore for dress an apron, or
bunch of a fibre resembling bass, suspended in front from the
centre of the girdle. Everything but the aprons was freely
parted with, but the modesty of the women was so strong&mdash;although
the men go completely unclad&mdash;that we could
not obtain them until we thought of tendering sufficient cloth
beforehand to serve as a skirt, and then, after draping this
about themselves, they were able to remove the girdle without
doing violence to their praiseworthy scruples. Both sexes
wore also about the neck a small reticule or purse, of netted
twine, which served as a hold-all, and often contained tobacco,
pipes, and fruit.</p>

<p>Both men and women cover themselves with a thick wash
of reddish clay, which, when fresh, gives them a very striking
appearance. On one of the men thus ornamented, the coating
was applied in this wise:&mdash;On the face a circular patch extending
from brow to chin, but leaving nose and lips black; on the
front and back of the body large elliptical patches, through
which, while wet, the fingers were evidently drawn, leaving broad
bands of four black stripes; the arms were covered to half-way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
down the forearm, and the wash was applied to the legs from
mid-thigh to shin. Several natives, besides this simple adornment,
were daubed on head and shoulders with a greasy mixture
of red pigment and fat.</p>

<p>The heads of both sexes were in various stages between
baldness and a covering of hair of fair thickness: they shave,
however, before the tufts reach the spiral state seen in the
natives frequenting Port Blair, and the hair is never allowed
to attain any length on temples and nape. Like those seen at
Rutland Island, their bodies were free from the tattooing or scarification
so noticeable on the South Andamanese. The man who
seemed to be chief of the tribe provided the only case of
elephantiasis remarked among these islands: it occurred with him
in a very mild form&mdash;merely a slight swelling of the left leg.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Having taken a series of photographs, during which operation
the women were the cause of much laughter, as they stood
in a row before the camera, we started off westwards along
the beach to visit the village and obtain more curiosities.
We set a rattling pace along the hot sand, to see what the little
people could do; but when, after travelling nearly four miles,
we reached the huts they occupied, those who had started with
us were still up, although they had to break into a jog trot
now and then to keep their position. They moved with a
very springy action, and a swing of the body from the hips.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 571px;">
<img src="images/fp040.jpg" width="571" height="415" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">&Ouml;NG&Eacute; HUT, LITTLE ANDAMAN.</span>
</div>

<p>The huts stand singly, at distances of several hundred yards
from each other, just within the shade of the jungle where it
comes down to the beach, and are very different in style and
construction from the majority of those of the northern islands.
They are built to the shape of a somewhat flattened cone, about 13
feet high, and 30 feet in diameter. On a framework of light sticks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
supported by twenty or more upright poles planted irregularly
about the interior, a thick covering of large mats is laid. The
mats are made by fastening the stripped mid-ribs of a species
of fern-palm side by side with a rattan lashing after the style
of a "chick," and then securing at right angles to the foundation
thus constructed a thick layer of the pinn&aelig; of the same plant.
For doors, several of the lower mats are arranged to roll up,
and leave an opening about 4 feet square. Sleeping platforms
are formed by laying split bamboos lengthwise on a
framework, measuring about 5 feet by 4 feet, which is raised
above the ground on legs 6 to 18 inches high. Each hut contains
a number of such bed-places, and beside each of them
were the ashes of a small fire.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 60%;">
<img src="images/p041.png" width="100%" alt="Little Andaman Canoe." title="Little Andaman Canoe." />
<span class="caption">Little Andaman Canoe.</span>
</div>

<p>Near the hut lay a nearly completed dug-out canoe (of the
wood of <i>Sterculia campanulata</i>), about 28 feet long by 3 feet
wide and deep, of the usual Andamanese form, with sawed-off
ends, and projecting platforms at bow and stern, forming
convenient places to stand on when spearing turtle and fish.
The sides were left about 1&frac14; inches thick; and although the
canoe was constructed from soft wood, even now, when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
possess a few iron tools, such as small axes and files, the work
must be one of painful slowness.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Their bows and arrows were like those from Rutland Island:
many of the former, however, were only 5 feet in length, while
of the latter some, in addition to the hardwood tip, had a bent
nail lashed on in such a way as to form both point and barb,
and the butts of all were left smooth.</p>

<p>By the time we had finished at the encampment, night was
drawing near, but fifteen or twenty men accompanied us when
returning. In the growing darkness the journey back was far
from easy: now we were ploughing through loose sand and
climbing over fallen trees, now dodging among mangrove roots,
or splashing thigh-deep through the water, which had risen
with the incoming tide. In such circumstances the natives
showed their superiority to ourselves by their agility in making
a way amongst roots and fallen trees, and by either their
better eyesight in the dark or familiarity with the path.
Evidently they had come with the intention of accompanying
us on board; for when the boat was reached, all got into it, and
we had some trouble in persuading them to leave. The coral
bottom at the anchorage was very bad holding-ground, and
had it come on to blow, we might have been compelled to put
to sea, in which case we did not wish to return. The natives
were perfectly harmless, as they had no weapons; but we had
no desire to leave an unpleasant impression for the benefit of
future visitors, so had recourse to gentle measures only.
All, however, clung to the sides and thwarts of the boat, and
gave vent to a chorus of refusal, "Nai, nai," and the childish
behaviour continued, until one, more hardly pressed than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
others, jumped overboard with a yell of rage, when the rest
immediately followed suit. We then found that a rowlock had
been carried off; but when we turned towards the shore with
the momentary idea of recovering it, the natives all disappeared
into the jungle, so we rowed off with three oars, and reached
the schooner about 7.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>Next morning, on landing to shoot, we found the little <i>contretemps</i>
of the night before entirely ignored, for a party of
natives was waiting for us at the creek.</p>

<p>Although, probably, not collected on before, the island, during
the few hours we spent on it, produced nothing fresh in the
way of birds. Abbott, however, bagged the pig peculiar to
the group (<i>Sus andamanensis</i>), which, like the human inhabitants,
is diminutive in stature. Our specimen, although a full-grown
boar, stood only 20 inches high at the shoulder, and
was just double that in length of head and body. He was
skinned on the spot, and the carcase, together with a viviparous
shark we had caught during the night, and a quantity of red
cotton, we presented to the natives as a parting gift, and then,
shaking hands with them all round, we said farewell to the
Andamans and put to sea.</p>

<p>"<i>21st January 1901.</i>&mdash;The American yacht <i>Terrapin</i> anchored
at S&aacute;wi Bay about 7 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> I sent men to inquire about
the vessel, and the gentlemen on board informed me that
they had come <i>via</i> Port Blair, and would land early next
morning.</p>

<p>"<i>22nd January 1901.</i>&mdash;Early this morning Dr Abbott and
Mr Kloss landed and came to 'Temple Villa,' and gave me
to understand the object of their visit. They remained here
till the 27th inst., and I gave them every possible help. They
left the island well pleased with their visit. Many Nicobarese
came from other villages with articles in the hope of purchasing
rum, but they were sadly disappointed: as I had begged the
gentlemen not to encourage the people with spirits, and they
complied with my request."&mdash;<i>From the diary of Catechist V.
Solomon.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>The wind was fair, but light, as, on 20th January 1901, we
left Bumila Creek for the Nicobars, and we sailed slowly along
the western coast of Little Andaman with the shore in full view.
A sandy beach ran all along, with here and there a crop of rock
breaking out, and behind it, stretching right across the island,
spread dense unbroken jungle.</p>

<p>At distant intervals along the shore stood several of the
peculiar conical huts, and as we proceeded southward the forest
gradually assumed the grey and twisted look due to the force
of the south-west winds.</p>

<p>Now, however, all was calm and still, and the <i>Terrapin</i>
sailed on such a steady upright keel, that photographs taken
the day before were developed without spilling any of the
solution used from the shallow dishes. Heavy rain, with which
we filled the tanks, fell during the night, and at noon next day
we sighted the low island of Kar Nicobar, lying some 22 miles
away.</p>

<p>As we neared the north-west part, after an 80 miles' sail, a
large village of beehive huts on posts came into view, and the
immense number of coconut palms along the eastern shore
was very striking.</p>

<p>West of the point, we sailed into a strong tide-race, the
current running against the wind at a rate of 4 to 5 knots, and
knocking up a heavy, broken sea, in which the schooner yawed
and rolled about, taking water on board from every direction.
Although the wind was dead aft, it was long before we made
any way. With the fore-topsail down, we remained stationary;
with it up, we gradually moved ahead. After a time, however,
the tide slackened, and we sailed slowly into S&aacute;wi Bay, where
we found a Moulmein brig, the <i>Princess of Wales</i>, loaded to her
bulwark rail with coconuts, and passing close by we anchored
inshore of her, in 7 fathoms, just as night fell.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>An
hour or two later, a large outrigger canoe brought
alongside a party of men&mdash;some of whom spoke English fairly&mdash;to
ascertain what we were; and by the rays of a lantern, we
obtained our first glimpse of the Nicobarese, who appeared,
with yellow-brown skin, straightish hair, and medium stature,
to be somewhat akin to Malays.</p>

<p>Here was a change indeed, both in place and people. From
islands densely jungle-covered to open stretches of grass-land
and groves of coco palms: from a little, black-skinned, frizzly-haired
race, in an exceedingly low plane of existence, to a brown-complexioned,
lank-haired people, of fair height, who are almost
semi-civilised, live in good dwellings, cultivate food products,
and possess domesticated animals.</p>

<p>The houses alone were typical of the change of race: those
of the Negro peoples&mdash;the stock to which the Andamanese
belong&mdash;are built directly on the ground, while here, among a
group of (practically) the Malayan race, the dwellings were
universally raised on piles.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>We landed next morning by wading through the surf, for
the sea, though smooth off-shore, was breaking on the
beach.</p>

<p>The shores of the bay rose precipitously from a beach of
sand to an average height of 30 feet, and showed plainly the
island formation of grey clay, sandstone, and overlying beds
of upheaved coral. Here and there, buttresses of sandstone
stood out boldly from the softer cliff, which had crumbled
away between them. Above, the land ran inward in a level,
unbroken stretch.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 570px;">

<span class="caption">KAR NICOBARESE FAMILY AND DWELLING-HOUSE, WITH LOUNGE BENEATH.</span>
</div>

<p>We were met almost immediately by Mr V. Solomon, a
Christian Madrassi, who fills the positions of meteorological
observer, port officer, schoolmaster, and catechist, and acts
unofficially as magistrate and amateur doctor. When we had
satisfied him that we were not the proverbial filibustering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
American schooner&mdash;or still more heinous, laden with a cargo
of spirits&mdash;he offered every assistance in his power, and put
the schoolhouse at our disposal, should we care to live
ashore.</p>

<p>A flight of broad stairs, built against the cliff, led to its
top, and then, after traversing two or three hundred yards of
broad road, the agent's bungalow&mdash;"Temple Villa"&mdash;and the
schoolhouse, both standing on an open piece of land purchased
from the natives, were reached.</p>

<p>In the clearing were sheds for the meteorological instruments,
a very deep well, the only one in Kar Nicobar, and enclosures
for several Indian cows that were kept by the agent. The
Nicobarese do not use milk, and a herd of cattle given to
them when the settlement at Nankauri was abolished, are now
roaming over Trinkat in a semi-wild state, very occasionally
losing one or two of their numbers by the spears of the
natives, to whom, at times, they afford a welcome supply of
food. The common pigeon was introduced into Kar Nicobar
in 1898, and numbers of them were to be seen in the vicinity of
the bungalow.</p>

<p>The village lay just beyond, on the eastern shore, for this
part of the island is merely a narrow arm projecting from the
main portion in a northern direction.</p>

<p>M&#363;s has a population of 530, and covers about half a
square mile of ground, the various groups of houses being
scattered irregularly about in picturesque disorder amongst
thickets of fruit-trees and fenced-in gardens.</p>

<p>All the buildings stand on thick piles,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> about 7 feet high,
but vary in architectural type. The living-houses (<i>pati</i>),
roughly about 20 feet in diameter, and 15-20 feet in height
from floor to apex, are in shape something between an inverted
basin and a pie-dish, covered with a heavy thatch of lallang
grass. Without windows or visible entrance, the interior is
reached by a neatly-made ladder of bamboo, or notched pole,
through a trapdoor in the floor, which works on hinges and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
has an alarum attached, so that any nocturnal intruder will
make his presence known.</p>

<p>The top of each pile is fitted with a large, circular, wooden
disc, to prevent the entry of rats and reptiles,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and beneath
the house, in the shade, there is generally a swing, and also
a platform of springy cane that serves the native for a lounge.
Baskets, bag-shaped and wide-meshed, hang from the piles,
and in these the hens are put when it is laying-time.</p>

<p>Inside, the walls are generally neatly lined with thin battens
of areca palm attached horizontally; up in the roof, a kind of
attic is formed, by means of a light shelving of areca or other
palm wood, having a square aperture left in the centre for
entrance. On the floor, which is also grated, are the wooden
clothes-chests that contain the family possessions, betel-boxes,
the mats of areca palm leaf, and the wooden head-rests which
are used when sleeping; and from the walls hang baskets,
spears, crossbows, suspensory contrivances made from small
branches with part of the twigs left on, and also some tobacco,
coconuts, and a piece of pork&mdash;the offering to the spirits.</p>

<p>The other type of building (<i>kamun telika</i>) is used as a
kitchen; it has a ridged but curved roof, an oblong floor, rounded
at the back and in front, and a platform, and a semicircular projection
of the roof to shade the doorway.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;">

<span class="caption">A KITCHEN HOUSE, M&#362;S VILLAGE.<br />
(Showing method of construction.)</span>
</div>

<p>At the further end the fireplace is situated. A flat block
of wood is hollowed out and covered with sand or clay, and
huge clay pots&mdash;often with a capacity of many gallons&mdash;stand
above it, on pieces of stone, raising them clear of the coconut
husks which are the principal fuel. Around lie pandanus fruit,
the boards and shells with which it is prepared for eating, and
the thorn-armed leaf-stems of the rattan, which the natives use
for grating up coconut. Up in the roof, are stuck, between
the thatch and the rafters, hollowed-out wooden troughs, in
which the food of the pigs, dogs, and other animals is prepared;
flat wooden dishes, provision baskets, and fans for blowing up
the fire, made of the sheathing petiole of palm trees, while,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
across the beams, are hung coconut shells&mdash;joined in pairs by
a short rattan handle&mdash;which contain the day's supply of
water.</p>

<p>The thatch of the houses&mdash;generally of lallang grass, but
sometimes of palm leaf&mdash;is fastened to a framework, built with
vertical rafters of the mid-ribs of the coco palm, joined crossways
by battens of areca wood, of which material the grated
floor is also made. Until recently, the whole structure was held
together by careful mortising and lashings of cane, but now it
is evident from the newer buildings that nails are coming into
use among the natives of this island for such work.</p>

<p>The houses stand in groups, on open sandy ground, and
interspersed with them are plantations (<i>ya</i>) of bananas, melons,
and sweet potatoes&mdash;protected from the numerous roving pigs by
zigzag fences of rails piled horizontally between double posts&mdash;and
clumps of fruit-trees of many varieties&mdash;coconut, orange,
lime, shaddock, soursop, jack champada, tamarind and papaya.</p>

<p>Sturdy brown-skinned natives, clad in the scantiest <i>kiss&aacute;ts</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
of red cotton, and wearing picturesque chaplets of white palm
leaf with long projecting ends (<i>t&aacute;-ch&ouml;kla</i>), stared at us as we
walked through the village; children and women, with a piece
of cotton cloth hitched round the waist, disappeared in the
houses as we approached. The teeth of all were stained by
constant betel-chewing, and, since the blacker the colour the
more beautiful is the owner according to local standard, to
produce this effect the teeth are never cleaned.</p>

<p>The dwelling-place of the headman (<i>mah</i>), who is named
Offandi, in no way differed from the others. We made our
presence known from below. "Wait," came a voice, "wait till
I've got my clothes on," and soon after the chief appeared in
a rusty suit of black broadcloth, and a damaged, bowler hat.
He was a short but exceedingly strong-looking man, with a
thick neck and bullet head, and wore a very slight moustache.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
We shook hands all round, and commenced asking each other
questions in English as we strolled through the village. Then,
after ascertaining that we should be pleased to see him on
board later, and provide spirituous refreshment, Offandi left us.</p>

<p>He was said to be very well off, possessing large numbers
of coco palms, but the other staple of wealth (pigs) he has to
buy.</p>

<p>We presently reached, near the shore, a group of buildings
known as <i>Elpanam</i> (The Place).<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Principal among these were
two buildings, in which feasts and meetings take place. While
of the same shape as the living-houses, they were much larger
in every way. The roof and floor are built on the ground,
and then, by the combined efforts of the whole village, are
raised to the supports on which they rest. They were constructed
inside of laths of areca, closely bound together, and
fastened horizontally to a framework covered with grass thatch,
a foot or more in thickness.</p>

<p>The floors were gratings of split palm wood, but a great
portion was planked, and on this solid part a large fireplace
was built of clay.</p>

<p>In the centre hung a rack, from which the joints of pork are
suspended at feast-times, and beneath were placed boards to
catch falling fat and grease.</p>

<p>Strings of pigs' jaws were hung across the upper part of the
roof, and showed the number of animals consumed at the last
feast&mdash;a ceremony that sometimes lasts a month.</p>

<p>The pigs, which are killed for these occasions by being
speared through the heart, are doubtless an introduced species,
for they attain immense proportions and are of many colours:&mdash;black
and white, brown, brown and white, etc. The young,
however, are all striped when born.</p>

<span class="caption">DEATH HOUSE, HOSPITALS, MATERNITY HOUSES, AND BURIAL-GROD, M&#362;S VILLAGE.</span>
</div>

<p>Adjacent to these "Town Halls"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> are the stores of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Burmese traders, some buildings which are equivalent to the
hospital of civilisation, and several maternity houses, where
women take up their residence shortly before confinement.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The starting-point in life, and also the place of departure,
is for the Nicobarese of this village one and the same, for next
to the house appointed for his birth is another&mdash;the "House of
Pollution"&mdash;to which he is carried to die; and yet a few paces
further is the burial-field, with its group of grave-posts, where
his body will be bestowed for a time. Not for long will it rest
even there, for in a few years the skeleton will be disinterred
and cast into the jungle&mdash;the skull alone, if he has been a man
of some importance in life, being allowed to find in the grave
an abiding place.</p>

<p>The shores of Kar Nicobar are in places very low, and
during bad weather the waves have been known to roll up
the beach and flood <i>Elpanam</i> a foot in depth, carrying away
canoes, etc. To subdue the sea on these occasions, <i>tamiluanas</i>
(medicine-men) and their followers, adorned with garlands,
walk in procession along the beach, with devil-destroying
rods and leaves, with which they strike the water, and then
surround <i>Elpanam</i> with palm leaves, and perform other
ceremonies.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the village, we saw here and there small
huts called <i>Talik n'gi</i>&mdash;the place of the baby. To these,
mothers come from <i>Elpanam</i> with the newborn child, and spend
several months in solitude, attended only by their husbands,
before returning to the village&mdash;a very sensible proceeding,
and one worthy of imitation in more civilised communities. It
seems only common justice that any unpleasantness caused
by ourselves in our earliest moments should be confined to those
most responsible for our appearance. So the Kar Nicobarese
appear to think, and have accordingly taken measures to prevent
new arrivals becoming a nuisance to their future com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>panions,
for many of the houses in the village contained perhaps
twenty inmates; doubtless, also, it is well for babies not to be
subjected to too much companionship and attention.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Again in the village we made the acquaintance of the
oldest inhabitant, yclept "Friend of England," who, judging
from the number of his <i>chits</i>, is a man of some note and many
acquaintances.</p>

<p>Clothed at first in an infinitesimal native garment, he retired
for a few moments, and then appeared in white jacket, knickerbockers,
and top hat, carefully brushed in the wrong direction.
He, too, would pay us a visit on board, provided that liquid
sustenance were afforded; and having satisfied himself on this
point, he intimated that we might count on his appearance
that afternoon.</p>

<p>Our attention was attracted by a somewhat rude mechanical
contrivance, beneath a tree, which we were told was a press
for extracting oil from coconuts. Two large blocks of wood,
one above the other, were placed closely against the trunk.
In the upper surface of the topmost log a shallow depression
had been made, and from this a channel ran to one edge,
which ended in a kind of lip. In the trunk itself a hole
had been scooped, to receive the end of a long beam of
wood.</p>

<p>A quantity of coconut kernel having been placed in the basin,
the beam is inserted in the tree, and a native standing on the
outer end, by jumping up and down exerts so much pressure
on the coconut that the oil oozes out, and running down the
channel, drips from the lip into an earthenware pot placed
beneath.</p>

<span class="caption">"TALIK N'GI" (the place of the baby), M&#362;S VILLAGE.</span>
</div>

<p>Here and there about the houses stood a kind of bench-seat,
that was merely the limb of a tree with several of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
branches left projecting, and trimmed in such a way that the
whole piece would balance firmly.</p>

<p>We obtained a number of birds in the trees about the
village; one in particular (<i>Ixora</i>, sp.?), whose leafless branches
bore a quantity of large red flowers, was frequented by flocks
of white-eyes (<i>Zosterops</i>(?), sp. nov.), munias, and sunbirds,
(<i>Arachnechthra</i>(?), sp. nov.), and by the chestnut-rumped
myna (<i>Sturnia erythropygia</i>), a bird only known from this island,
although we later collected on Kachal a new species that
closely resembles it.</p>

<span class="caption">Oil Press (Kar Nicobar).</span>
</div>

<p>The canoes (<i>&aacute;p</i>) belonging to the village were drawn up
on the shore of S&aacute;wi Bay, for the other beach is fully exposed
to the monsoon, and also fronted by an awkward reef. These
vessels&mdash;all dug-outs&mdash;constructed from a single trunk (<i>Calophyllum
spectabile</i>),<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> are very narrow in proportion to their length, and
of graceful shape. After the canoe is hollowed, it is somewhat
spread out by cross-pieces of wood, which are lashed from
gunwale to gunwale, at intervals of about a foot. To give
the requisite stability, an outrigger is attached:&mdash;To two projecting
spars or wings lashed to the canoe, a log of very light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
wood (<i>Sterculia alata</i>), about three-quarters the length of the
hull, and sharp at either end, is fastened, and the correct level
of this float is maintained by each wing being bound to, and
resting in, the angle made by three intersecting pairs of hardwood
pegs, which are driven into the outrigger. The vessels are further
provided with ornamental projecting stem- and stern-pieces
(<i>C. inophyllum</i>), carved in a variety of designs, and sometimes
painted red. No paint or wood-oil is used on the canoes, but
the outer surface of the hull is charred all over, with the idea
of protecting it from the effects of the water.</p>

<p>The paddles are about 4 feet long, very light and thin, made
of a hard red-brown wood (<i>Garcinia speciosa</i>), with lancet-shaped
blades, and handles without any form of cross-piece,
but flattened at the top.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Offandi came on board, and after drinking
a glass of rum, begged for a bottleful to take ashore. As this
request was not complied with, he cried threateningly in a
menacing tone, "What, you refuse me then?" but calmed down
on learning, that, although we were not at liberty to supply
him with spirits "for consumption off the premises," he could
have what he wanted whenever he liked to come aboard. A
bottle of Eno fully restored his good humour, and drew forth
expressions of friendship: "You good man, I love you; you do
me good turn, I make return." This reciprocity is the basis
of Kar Nicobarese relations with strangers&mdash;value for value, and
no gifts; although Offandi once presented us with an edible
bird's-nest without asking for an equivalent.</p>

<p>One man, "Sweet William" of Lap&aacute;ti, carried this trait so
far, that he wanted a steamer to take him to England, in
order that he might there build a house for himself, and occupy
a piece of land in lieu of the plot at M&#363;s that has been
purchased by the Indian Government.</p>

<span class="caption">KAR NICOBARESE.</span>
</div>

<p>The headman was, for a Nicobarese, a very travelled
individual, for he had spent a month in Calcutta, ten days in
Penang, and various periods at Port Blair; and as a result, had
a really working knowledge of several languages. English,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Hindustani, and Kamortan, he speaks well, and has some
acquaintance with Malay and Burmese.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Visits to the <i>Terrapin</i> occurred frequently during our stay,
but none were of long duration, for a growing squeamishness
on the part of our guests generally cut them short.</p>

<p>Although accustomed to travel in canoes, they could not
withstand the motion of the schooner. Indeed, for the whole
time we lay in S&aacute;wi Bay, the <i>Terrapin</i>, on account of the swell
that set into the bay, so rocked and rolled at her anchor that
life on board was scarcely comfortable. The fiddle was always
on the table, the preparation of our specimens went on under
difficulties, and at night sleep was almost impossible unless we
wedged ourselves on our mattresses by means of extra cushions
and pillows. The vessel frequently took water over her sides,
until at times it almost seemed that she would roll her masts
out. We generally had to exercise the greatest care in leaving
or boarding the ship, and yet with it all the sea was quite
unbroken save for the line of surf along the beach. The bigger
trading-vessels&mdash;brigs and barquentines&mdash;anchored more off
shore, and, because of their greater size, were scarcely affected
by the motion.</p>

<p>Whenever the tide was low, the reef-bordered portions of the
coast were always frequented by various parties of natives, busily
occupied in searching in the pools and under the coral boulders
for fish, crabs, and molluscs; at night, when the sea was calm,
bright fires blazed on the water and the shore, and marked
where fish-spearing was going on from sheltered ledges of
rock or slowly-moving canoes.</p>

<p>Of all the people, "Friend of England" was perhaps the most
amusing. He was infected with the garrulity of old age, and
made the most of his opportunities by unblushing mendicancy.</p>

<p>As he came alongside, sitting&mdash;a very dignified figure in
top-hat and white knickerbockers&mdash;upright and motionless in
his canoe, which was manned by juvenile paddlers, he always,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
as he neared the schooner, took from his pocket an old silk
cravat and arranged it round his neck.</p>

<p>After a few coconuts or oranges had been handed up, the
old man would come below and shake hands all round. "I
want smoke cigar, I want drink rum," was followed by a prompt
refusal of anything smaller than a tumbler. Then would come
the invariable preamble: "You my friend, I your friend; we give
presents and make return,"&mdash;with reference to the coconuts;
followed by demands for medicine, turpentine, camphor, quinine,
scent, and Eno; and as all his wants could not be satisfied, he
professed he could not understand why on earth we had come
without these things. When we came again we were to bring
all of them, and we should then be great friends. He desired that
we would convey the following to every one at home&mdash;foreigners
he did not like:&mdash;"You go tell all men&mdash;Come here, come here,
come here. I Friend of England, I good man. You bring much
medicine, you give me&mdash;we be great friends, I make return. I
plenty good man; I speak true, I no lie!"</p>

<p>He carried a large number of <i>chits</i> from officers of ships
that had called here during many years past, and was very
anxious that we should add to the number.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<span class="caption">"FRIEND OF ENGLAND."</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>Poor
old "Friend of England"! his lines are no longer cast
in pleasant places. His last wife, the widow of a friend, became
blind, and he can no longer obtain another on account of his
old age; he has become estranged from his son because of his
too amorous conduct towards the latter's wife, and has had to
pay several fines on account of similar behaviour towards other
neighbours.</p>

<p>Our last glimpse of him as he made for the shore, after
having been assisted to his canoe, generally caught him in
the act of undoing his cherished necktie and restoring it, carefully
folded, to his pocket.</p>

<p>One day&mdash;when we had so far broken through our rule
as to give him a bottle of rum and water to take ashore "for
medicine after we had gone"&mdash;going a couple of hours later
into the village, we found "Friend of England" tottering up a
path, and tried to take his portrait. But the old scamp, who
all his life had lived in the sun, refused on this occasion to
come out of the shade, and was so afflicted with involuntary
staggers, that the result of several exposures was a very
qualified success, and lost much of the impressiveness of the
original, through his unwillingness to don his necktie in the
customary Byronic style.</p>

<p>One of our guides about the island was "Frank Thompson,"
one of Mr Solomon's "most promising pupils, and a sincere
Christian"&mdash;a rather stupid-looking youth, who had spent some
years at the Port Blair School. I fear that we regarded him
with some contempt, for he seemed to have developed into
nothing better than a hanger-on at the Agency, and although
he spoke English fairly well, and could doubtless read and
write a little, in the jungle he proved to be quite useless. Birds
he could scarcely ever see; he did not know the way about,
and after a few miles, he was blowing and panting, and
groaning inquiries as to how much farther he was to go.
Thompson however could beg as well as the rest, nor was he
out of his element when the rum and cigars were being passed
round.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>A very different character was my <i>shikari</i> "Little John,"
native name unknown. This man was perhaps, on the whole, the
best specimen physically of a Nicobarese that we came across.
A handsome, rather scornful, face, with aquiline nose, was only
spoiled by the occurrence of the Mongolian fold in the inner
corner of the eyelids. His curly black hair was worn long,
in a thick bushy mass, as far as his shoulders, where it was cut
off straight across. Though only 5 feet 6 inches in height,
he was splendidly built: was 40 inches round the chest, 13&frac12;
inches round the biceps, and 15 inches round the calf. The
natives admitted that he was about the strongest man in the
village of M&#363;s.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>He was awfully keen on collecting; could creep noiselessly
through the jungle, and saw birds that I took long to distinguish,
even after he had pointed them out. He was also
a good "pot-shot," and nothing delighted him more than to
carry the gun, and after having it loaded with cartridge
suitable to the occasion, to fire at and bring down the
specimen, when he would hand the weapon to me and dash
away amongst the undergrowth to retrieve his booty, bringing
it back with the greatest care.</p>

<p>He was an unwearying hunter, and would often creep about
for ten minutes at a time, under some tree, in order to point
out for my approval, and get a clear shot at, some bird whose
presence he had discovered in the dense foliage.</p>

<p>He used to accompany us on board the schooner, and after
having breakfasted with the crew, would sit in the cabin with
a cigar, watching us as we worked at the skins, and improving
his little English by constant inquiries: "How you call dis?
What you call dat?"</p>

<p>The desire of the Nicobarese to learn words, and acquire
the name of anything they do not know, is great, and their
powers of memory are astonishing. The exercise of these
linguistic abilities is most marked in the headmen, or "captains"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
as they love to be called&mdash;a title inherited from the times when
English skippers used to trade amongst these islands, and
bestow by request their own names (and others less complimentary,
but more pointed) on the natives they particularly
favoured in their commercial transactions.</p>

<p>Nor were these our only acquaintances. "Sweet William"
(who had a mouth and teeth like a shark's), W. L. Distant,
Tom Noddy, Lady Clara, Sam Weller, and many others, came
to see us. There was, too, Mr Corney Grain, who, many
people may not be aware, is chief of a village in S&aacute;wi Bay,
and who dresses in two yards of pink ribbon.</p>

<p>In this way we were never at a loss for company, for when
the above were engaged, there was always a reserve in the
persons of Jack Robinson, Tom Tuson, Kingfisher, Young
Edwin, James Snooks, Lorenzo, Lady-killer, and others.</p>

<p>Mr Solomon's efforts in education have received little
support from the community; for by handing over their
children to his discipline, the parents lose their assistance
in the routine of daily work, no small portion of which falls to
the younger generation, since almost all special work is done
by small boys. These are very helpful in climbing the coco
palms for the nuts required for barter, and they are of much
assistance to the foreign traders also, who, to induce the boys
to aid them, supply them with food, and give them presents
of tobacco and other things. However, some fifteen or twenty
boys, from 8 to 14 years of age, have now been given up to
the mission school,<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to receive a little daily instruction and
drill, on condition that the onus of feeding and clothing them
shall not fall upon the parents.</p>

<p>Out of school hours these boys make themselves generally
useful by fetching and carrying, preparing food, etc., and acting
as crew of the agent's canoe.</p>

<p>That such a life is not universally pleasing to the youngsters
themselves, is witnessed by the fact that a short time ago one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of them ran away to the jungle, where he remained, and was
able to support himself, until caught and brought back after a
three months' disappearance.</p>

<p>He was a mischievous-looking boy, who found it hard to
refrain from grinning while his portrait was being taken, for
I secured his likeness as affording a marked example of the
features of prognathism and epicanthus as occurring among the
Nicobarese.</p>

<p>We found the services of these boys most welcome on several
occasions. Frequently the surf in the bay was sufficient to
promise at the least a thorough wetting when leaving shore
for the schooner in our own boat. It was, as a rule, simple
enough to land, but the reverse proceeding was a less simple
matter. In such a case, we used one of the native canoes and
a crew of mission lads.</p>

<p>After loading the light hull with our impedimenta, it was
an easy business to place it at the water's edge, and, at a
suitable opportunity, run it out into waist-deep water, jump on
the almost uncapsizable hull, and with quickly-grasped paddles&mdash;no
troublesome operation of shipping lengthy oars in row-locks&mdash;force
the slender craft beyond the breakers. Arrived
at the schooner, a biscuit apiece seemed to be considered ample
reward by our young friends (biscuits, stale bread, and old
crusts are in great request among the Nicobarese), who, after
disposing of them, would return to their canoe and disappear
into the darkness with cheery farewell cries: "Good-<i>night</i>; good-night,
sar; <i>go-o-od</i>-night."</p>

<span class="caption">MISSION BOYS AND BURMESE TEACHER, KAR NICOBAR.</span>
</div>

<p>Early in our visit, we one morning met with a mishap when
landing in our stumpy dinghy through some more than usually
heavy surf. The surroundings were scarcely such as one
would connect our late Laureate with, but at the moment of
catastrophe, some lines of his flashed into my mind:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">
"'Courage,' he said, and pointed to the land,<br />
'This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon,'"<br />
</p></div>

<p class="noidt">and indeed it did. A big breaker rose under the stern, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
flung the boat, its contents, and ourselves, far up the beach.
Fortunately our guns and cartridges were made up into bundles
with waterproof canvas, so no harm was done beyond losing a
rowlock.</p>

<p>From the incident we learned a lesson, and thereafter, had
the proverbial New Zealander been on the beach in the early
mornings, he might have seen a little boat approach the shore,
with a blue-clad, brown-skinned Malay and a couple of white
men <i>in puris naturalibus</i>. Outside the belt of surf, the latter
would jump overboard, and, seizing favourable opportunities,
wade to and fro with sundry bundles. Presently the dinghy
would return, with a solitary occupant, to a schooner in the
bay, while the others, after assuming a simple toilet and a
peculiar sporting equipment, would disappear from his view,
leaving the Antipodean observer alone on the shore. Although
a little farther from the village, the best landing-place when
the sea is rough is on the stretch of sand next to that adjacent
to M&#363;s, and just to westward and inside the rocky point that
separates the two strips of beach.</p>

<p>Sometimes we shot in the scrub and plantations surrounding
the village, and sometimes we went a few miles along the
bay towards S&aacute;wi, now walking on the beach, now along the
brow of the cliffs. The view from these last was very beautiful:
on the one hand a forest of palms, pandanus and casuarina
trees, on the other a line of waving grass; and below, the blue
sea breaking in snowy rollers on a golden beach.</p>

<p>At times we met parties of natives proceeding from village
to village in picturesque groups&mdash;the men carrying nothing
but a <i>d&aacute;o</i>, their warm-brown stalwart figures relieved only by
the red <i>kiss&aacute;t</i> and white chaplet of pandanus with which
their hair was bound; and the women draped in scarlet cotton,
and adorned with chains of rupees and numerous silver
bangles.</p>

<p>All would stare stolidly, and pass in silence; for in the
Nicobars, where one man is as good as the next, and no
degrees of rank are known, there are no words of greeting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
or graceful salutes such as one would meet with amongst
strange Malays or natives of India.</p>

<p>The forest at S&aacute;wi was open, and although of a heavy
description, grew on land that seemed of very recent formation.
It contained some of the finest specimens of urostigma
trees we had ever seen, whose many a&euml;real roots, springing
from a wide expanse of ground, met far overhead in support
of immense masses of foliage.</p>

<p>In this heavy jungle we obtained specimens of <i>Astur butleri</i>,
a little forest hawk with back and wings of a beautiful dark
grey, allied species to which are found in several of the other
islands. Here, too, we met with <i>Carpophaga insularis</i>, a
variety of a widely-spread fruit-pigeon, <i>C. &aelig;nea</i>, from which
it differs only in having a plumage slightly less bright. We
made acquaintance also with <i>Pal&aelig;ornis erythrogenys</i>, an exceedingly
pretty parrot, and the only bird of its kind occurring
in the Nicobars until <i>P. caniceps</i> is reached in the southern
islands; but of the mound-building megapodes we had expected
to find, there was no trace, although it was said they occurred
in the middle of the island.</p>

<p>We obtained in the jungle one specimen of a hitherto unknown
fruit-bat (<i>Pteropus faunulus</i>); but of rats, although
they are probably numerous, one only was trapped (<i>Mus
burrulus</i>, sp. nov.); crabs in nearly every instance making off
with the baits.</p>

<p>As a rendezvous after our collecting excursions, we generally
chose "Temple Villa," where we could sit and chat with the
agent on the manners and customs of the natives among whom
he lived, and drink the water of young coconuts freshly plucked
from the trees surrounding the bungalow.</p>

<p>The coconut of the Nicobars, although small, is nowhere
excelled for sweetness and flavour, and on reaching the schooner,
drenched with perspiration after a morning's wandering in the
forest, and perhaps a long row under the hot midday sun, we
daily made appreciative trial of them the moment we stepped
on board.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The natives are very expert in opening them with the <i>d&aacute;o</i>.
Holding the nut in the palm of the left hand, they slash off a
portion of the husk, toss it round and remove another slice,
until, with three or four cuts, the tender shell at the upper end
is exposed, and only requires a slight tap to be broken through
and allow the delicious water inside to reveal itself with a
spurt.</p>

<p>The life of the Nicobarese is full of curious observances and
ceremonies, of which, perhaps, no man knows more than
Mr Solomon, who has spent five years among the people, and
is engaged in the preparation of a vocabulary of their
language.</p>

<p>In his capacity as catechist, he has not succeeded in converting
any of his adult neighbours to Christianity, although one or
two are occasionally present at his Sunday services. We met
with one proselyte to Mohammedanism among them, but
he, having been adopted by a trader when a boy, was taken
to the Maldives and spent some years there. The natives as
a body are still as averse to foreign influence on this point as
they have been in the past, when missionary endeavour&mdash;Moravian
and Jesuit&mdash;time after time met with complete
failure. In the second quarter of the last century they expelled
two priests of the latter sect from the island, and Captain Gardner,
in 1851, gives an account of the same fate befalling a pair of
Moravians.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> "Having converted a few natives, disputes arose
between these and their heathen countrymen. They were of
such a serious nature that it was determined to hold a general
council of delegates from every village to consider a remedy
for the evil. They came to the conclusion, that, as they had
always lived in love and amity with each other before the
arrival of the missionaries, with their strange story of the first
woman stealing the orange, etc., the obvious remedy was to
send them away. Accordingly, the missionaries were waited
on, and told respectfully that they must leave at the first
opportunity: that the natives were not to be joked with, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
must be obeyed. The mission house was then burnt down, and
a fence erected round the spot, inside which no native will step.
It is unholy ground, they say, where the devil first landed; for,
until the missionaries brought him with them, he had never
been in the island, or knew where it was. I was told that a
day is now set apart in the year when all the inhabitants assemble
to drive the devil out of the island."</p>

<p>On the fourth morning of our visit our sympathy was due
to Mr Solomon on the occasion of his wife's death&mdash;an event
that occurred with some suddenness as the result of an apoplectic
fit. One sequel to this was, that on the following night the
entire village was engaged in expelling the spirit of the deceased
from the neighbourhood with much ceremony and noise.</p>

<p>Kar Nicobar has an area of about 50 square miles, with a
surface that is exceedingly level, as the highest point it attains
is barely 200 feet above the sea-level; only in the north does
the coast rise in low cliffs, and all round the shore is a fringe of
coral-reef.</p>

<p>The geological formation consists of a foundation of serpentine,
on which rest thick clay beds and layers of sandstone,
exposed in parts, and in some places overlaid by upheaved coral
banks, the whole having acquired a covering of sandy alluvium
and drift, which was deposited before upheaval, with an additional
layer of vegetable <i>d&eacute;bris</i> since accumulated.</p>

<p>With the exception of an indigenous coco palm zone, where
coralline alluvium has formed, the beach forest of Casuarinas,
Barringtonias, Ficus, Pandani, Hibiscus, Calophyllums, and other
characteristic species, and irregular strips of inland forests, containing
canebrake and bamboo, with Terminalias and Sterculias,
the whole island appears to be covered with stretches of coarse
lallang grass, dotted with tall screw-pines (<i>Pandanus mellori</i>),
bearing the large globular fruit that supplies the inhabitants
with their staple food; or with the natives' plantations of coconuts,
betel, plantains, and yams. The nature of the forests depends
entirely on the character of the soil and on the composition of
the underlying rock.</p>

<p>Although ranking only fourth or fifth in point of size, Kar
Nicobar contains nearly three-fifths of the total population
of the group; the number of its inhabitants has remained
stationary for many years, and has lately been ascertained to
stand at a trifle under 3500.</p>

<p>"The people of Kar Nicobar ought to be among the most
contented in the world. Everyone lives on terms of perfect
equality with his neighbours. Beyond occasional illnesses, they
have no cares or troubles, and there is absolutely no struggle
for existence, coconuts and pandanus, their staple foods, being
in such profusion that a child old enough to climb a tree could
support himself without exertion."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Our sojourn at Kar Nicobar lasted from the 21st to 27th of
January, and was spent in making a collection of the fauna (which
was not entirely without result in the way of new species), and
in obtaining as much information as possible about the natives
during the opportunities open to us. Besides this, we secured,
through the agent, a fairly representative series of such articles
as are used by the islanders in their daily occupations and
pursuits.</p>

<p>The well from which we filled our tanks was situated near
the agent's house: no good water was to be obtained elsewhere
in the bay. In this well the water rose and fell with the tides,
the explanation of which is, not that the sea-water is filtered
by the coral sand, but that fresh and salt water do not combine;
the former rests on the latter, which is of course heavier, and
the close and porous coral rock prevents the mixture of the two.</p>

<p>Having given all the time we could spare to Kar Nicobar,
and found it a most interesting locality and one worthy of far
more protracted attention, it was with feelings of regret that on
the 26th we, as Dampier would say, "refreshed ourselves very
well with hens, coconuts, and oranges, and the next day sailed
from thence."</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">On</span> our course to Tilanchong, we passed, after leaving the south
end of Kar Nicobar, within a few miles of the little island of
Batti Malv. It is scarcely more than a mile in length, and
except towards the N.W., where it is somewhat flattened, falls
steeply to the sea from a height of 150 feet. It is uninhabited,
but the low jungle with which it is covered is the abode of
countless numbers of pigeons&mdash;principally of the Nicobar variety&mdash;which
are said to be so tame and fearless that they can be
killed with sticks.</p>

<p>A little later Teressa hove in sight, a grey cloud on the
horizon, and soon after we caught sight of our destination right
ahead. It was midnight before the island was reached, and
not caring to find an anchorage in the dark, we drifted gently
northward under jib and mainsail, until at daybreak we were
opposite the extreme point, where we turned and ran slowly
south, keeping close inshore.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;">
<img src="images/fp066.jpg" width="584" height="415" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">TERRAPIN BAY, TILANCHONG.</span>
</div>

<p>All the way along until the centre is reached, the island, 500
feet high and nowhere more than a mile and a half broad, rises in
almost precipitous cliffs of serpentine, with deep water at their
feet, while the principal vegetation consists of thickets of pandanus
in the gullies, and here and there, in spite of the rocky ground,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
patches of luxuriant forest.  We passed three small beaches,
above which grew a few coco palms, and then came to Novara
Bay, about 3 miles from the north end of the island, where
the Austrian frigate anchored in 1858. It was, however, on
account of the steepness of the land, an impracticable place for
collecting. South of this point the island is everywhere covered
with dense jungle, and for the next 4 miles expands to a breadth
of more than a mile, attaining in the centre its greatest
elevation in Maharani Peak, a little over 1000 feet in height.
A short distance further on, and opposite two rocky islets,
each about 80 feet high, we found a good anchorage, which,
being unnamed on the chart, was promptly christened
"Terrapin Bay." It affords fair protection in the north-east
monsoon, and shoals gradually from 12 fathoms to the beach.
The latter is about three-quarters of a mile long, and is divided
by a huge mass of rocks covered with casuarina trees, behind
which is a small stream of brackish water. Numerous coco
palms shade the beach, and beyond them is a stretch of flat,
jungle-covered land. Good water may be obtained at a little
sandy spot beyond the rocks forming the northern point of
the bay. There is also an anchorage on the other side of
the island in Castle Bay.</p>

<p>Tilanchong is 9 miles long and 1&frac14; miles broad at its widest
point, and has an area of about 7 square miles. It is rocky,
and everywhere covered with jungle, except in the north, and
in shape resembles a flying bird with the north and south
extremities as wings, and the broader part in the centre, head,
and body.</p>

<p>Our landing at midday was a pleasant contrast to the
experiences of Kar Nicobar; the sea was fairly calm, and
damage to guns and ammunition was no longer to be feared.
On entering the jungle, which at first was somewhat thin, we
were immediately struck by the extreme fearlessness of the
birds, and the immense number of lizards, of a species peculiar
to this island (<i>Gonyocephalus humeii</i>), which abounded everywhere.
Every tree-trunk in the forest was the resting-place of two or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
three of the latter, and as one moved along it was to an
accompaniment of scurrying reptiles that dropped from the
adjacent branches and darted off to a less immediate neighbourhood.
Especially did they swarm in the jungle growing on the
dry coral sand above the beach. Besides this small species we
found a <i>Varanus</i> lizard, 5 to 6 feet long&mdash;very common. We
frequently saw them, or heard their noisy rush through the
bushes, as, disturbed by our approach, they galloped out of
danger. Of the birds, the splendid fruit-pigeons (<i>Carpophaga
insularis</i>), generally so wary and unapproachable, denizens of
the highest tree-tops, were so unsuspicious that time after time
we knocked them over with a pinch of dust shot, and parrots
and Nicobar pigeons were obtained with almost equal ease.
The latter, whose range extends from these islands eastward
to the Solomons, are extremely beautiful birds. The feet are
plum-coloured, and the stumpy tail, which is almost hidden by
the wings, is snow-white. The head and neck are a delicate
grey, while the long, flowing hackles and the rest of the plumage
are of a glorious metallic green, iridescent in the sunlight, with
shining tints of gold, purple, and blue.</p>

<p>We had not long separated before I caught sight of two
megapodes scuttling through the bushes&mdash;dull-brown birds
about the size of a six-months'-old chicken. They disappeared
before I could shoot, but, close by to where they had been, I
found one of their laying-places, a mound of fresh earth about
4 feet high and 12 feet in diameter, disturbed by recent
working.</p>

<p>For a few hundred yards beyond the beach the soil is very
light and friable, a mixture of vegetable loam and disintegrated
coral; but behind this it becomes swampy, supporting a densely-matted
growth, and while collecting amongst this, I lost my
bearings and spent a warm half-hour cutting a way back to
the more open forest in the vicinity of the boat.</p>

<span class="caption">A MEGAPODE.</span>
</div>

<p>"<i>January 30.</i>&mdash;This morning got my first megapode. Soon
after landing, I saw a Nicobar pigeon on the ground, and while
stalking it to get a close shot, noticed near by three birds, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
much the same size, dancing about amongst some bushes.
They were out of sight most of the time, but I 'browned' the
place with a heavy charge, and running up found a cock
megapode lying dead. In appearance the bird is not unlike
a partridge, though larger, and it has the same drooping tail;
the feet, however, are out of all proportion, and are remarkable
for their extraordinary strength and size; the plumage is olive-brown
in colour, except on the head, which is thinly covered
with pale greyish feathers, while the cheeks are naked and of
a bright vermilion.</p>

<p>"Going further south than yesterday, I found beyond the rock,
in the middle of the beach, what was probably once a fair-sized
lagoon, but is now an open swamp nearly overgrown with grass
and nipah palms. Several small water-birds and a couple of
herons were flying about, and of the latter I obtained a white
variety.</p>

<p>"We spent about an hour on shore in the afternoon and saw
some more megapodes, but failed to get a shot at them: they
frequent the open jungle directly bordering the shore, where the
soil is so light that they can build their mounds with ease."</p>

<p>"<i>January 31.</i>&mdash;On leaving the <i>jheel</i> this morning, as I walked
over the rise of ground that separates it from the sea, I saw a
crocodile lying half-in and half-out of the water, but before I
could get near enough for a shot-cartridge to take effect he
turned and swam off; as he rose and fell with the waves, he
looked like a log of wood, but all the while made steadily seaward;
he was about 10 feet long, and brilliantly marked with
yellow.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon I took the camera ashore to get photos
of a nest-mound. Just as I was entering the jungle by the
mound, I noticed that earth was being thrown in a continuous
shower from the top. Soon a bird ran out from a
depression there; I shot it, and at the noise another jumped
out for a moment and then went on digging, but appearing
again a few seconds later, I got it also. It was about to lay, but
the shot had unfortunately broken the egg: there is no external<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
difference in the appearance of the sexes, but these were a pair,
and it is therefore evident that when the hen is about to deposit
the egg, the male assists in excavating the hole in which it is
to be buried for incubation. The mound on which they were
busy was between 7 and 8 feet high, and rather more than
100 feet in circumference, and had a large coco palm growing
through the centre. It would certainly be the work of
a number of birds, and must have taken many years to
build."</p>

<p>We got four more megapodes on February 1, one of them
containing an unbroken egg of a size remarkable for so small
a bird; it measured 3&#8540; inches by 2<small><sup>3</sup></small>&frasl;<small><sub>16</sub></small> inches.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The shell is very
thick, and when new of a pinkish colour, which changes in the
earth to a dirty buff. The temperature of a nest-mound, which
we dug into without success in a search for eggs, rapidly increased
towards the centre: it was composed of light sandy soil, with
apparently no addition of leaves or grass other than that lying
about on the earth employed by the birds; the species does not
seem purposely to include vegetable matter for causing heat by
fermentation.</p>

<p>We failed, whilst here, to obtain a single specimen of a rat;
the island is much cut up with holes, high and low, but they are
those of crabs, who here also&mdash;as on Barren Island and in Kar
Nicobar&mdash;made off with our baits, leaving behind in some of the
traps a quarry we did not at all desire. The only mammal obtained
was a large fruit-bat (<i>Pteropus nicobaricus</i>), of which Abbott
found a camp up the stream and shot several for specimens.
Tracks of pig were seen.</p>

</div>

<p>The island is uninhabited, and seems to have been in the
same state for some time. In Hamilton's <i>Voyages</i> some account
is given of the adventures of a shipwrecked crew, whose vessel,
commanded by a Captain Owen, was lost there in 1708. They
found the place unpeopled, and, making fires in the night, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
taken off by several canoes that came across from the Nankauri
group.</p>

<p>Their further adventures, although more properly appertaining
to the history of the central islands of the Nicobars, may as
well, for the sake of continuity, be given here.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The natives," writes Hamilton, "... very courteously
carried the shipwrecked men to their islands of Ning and Goury,
with what little things they had saved of their apparel and other
necessaries.</p>

<p>"The captain had saved a broken knife about four inches long
in the blade, and he having laid it carelessly by, one of the
natives made bold to take it, but did not offer to hide it. The
captain, finding his knife in the poor native's hand, took it from
him and bestowed some kicks and blows on him for his ill
manners, which were taken very ill, for all in general showed
they were dissatisfied with the action; and the shipwrecked men
could observe contention arising among those who were their
benefactors in bringing them to the island, and others who were
not concerned in it: however, next day, as the captain was sitting
under a tree at dinner, there came about a dozen of the natives
towards him and saluted him with a shower of darts made of
heavy wood, with their points hardened in the fire, and so he
expired in a moment.</p>

<p>"How far they had a mind to pursue their resentment I know
not, but the benefactors of the shipwrecked men kept guard
about their house till next day, and then presented them with
two canoes, and fitted them with outleagers to keep them from
overturning, and put some water in pots, some coconuts and dry
fish, and pointed to them to be immediately gone, which they
did.</p>

<p>"Being six in company, they divided equally, and steered their
course for Junkceylon, but in the way one of the boats lost her
outleager and drowned all her crew. The rest arrived safely,
and I carried them afterwards to Masulipatam."</p></div>

<p>People from Kamorta, from which it can be seen, and who
own the plantations on it, come to the island from time to time
for the sake of the coconuts, of which there are a fair quantity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
we found traces of visitors in the remains of two tumble-down
huts and a liberal scattering of pigs' skulls.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor at 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, but it was an hour and a half later
before we passed the two off-lying islets, for, every few seconds,
flaws of wind, coming over the high land, so changed in force
and direction that we could get no steerage way, but helplessly
boxed the compass all over the bay before we caught a steady
breeze. We found deep water between the islets close to the
southernmost; everywhere else the ground seemed foul. With
a 3-knot breeze we sailed along the western shore, which at this
end is much lower than the north, and densely wooded, presenting
to view several white beaches and groves of coco palms,
while not far from shore are numerous off-lying rocks that continue
in a south-easterly direction for about 3 miles from the end of
Tilanchong and terminate in a fair-sized islet, named Isle of
Man.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>The island of Kamorta lies some 12 miles to the south, the
adjacent part rising in low grass-covered hills, with occasional
trees dotted about: along the coast runs a fringe of vegetation
and coconut trees, while in the centre, where the island is about
450 feet high, it is more thickly covered with forest. Trinkat,
closely adjoining it on the east, is very low, and from the sea,
seems overgrown with jungle. Darkness had fallen before we
reached the southern entrance of Beresford Channel, that runs
between it and Kamorta, and proceeding inwards for a short
distance, we anchored at 9.45 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span></p>

Shom Pe&#7749;&mdash;The Sequel to a Death&mdash;Interior of the Houses.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Trinkat</span> is a low, flat island about five miles long and one
wide, separated from Kamorta by the narrow strait in which
we anchored. This is much choked with coral-reefs, on which
every now and then the sea breaks unexpectedly in low waves
which run along their edges throwing up clouds of spray.
Several villages, fronted by rows of streamer-decorated poles,
were in sight on the western shores, and further up the
channel a junk from Penang was anchored, the first we had
seen. The island is nowhere higher than 80 or 90 feet, and
is superficially of limestone formation&mdash;raised coral: the shores
are fringed with jungle and coco palms, while the latter are
frequent also in the patches of jungle occurring in the interior,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
which, however, consists mainly of open undulating grassy land.</p>

<p>We landed, after crossing the reef, near a couple of huts,
built of palm leaves and rough planks, that seemed deserted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
A great number of pigs were roaming about in company with
dogs, fowls, and a cat. The huts were surrounded for some
distance by palm trees growing in thick scrub undergrowth.
A little way along a path we arrived at a small <i>jheel</i>, on which
were a diver and several whistling teal. Birds were numerous
amongst the trees, where parrots (<i>P. erythrogenys</i>) and pigeons
dwelt in flocks, and on the ground megapodes ran about
calling to each other, but were too well concealed, by the tall
grass and bushes that grew everywhere, for successful collecting.
We got here the Nicobar fly-catcher, in plumage of dark chestnut,
with steely-black head, and <i>Geocichla albigularis</i>, a pretty
grey, olive and cinnamon thrush, a shy bird that kept down
on the ground or hid itself in low bushes. Out in the open,
amongst the grass, we found numbers of small warblers (<i>Cisticola
cisticola</i>), an occasional snipe or two, and flocks of little button-quail
(<i>Excalfactoria</i>(?), sp. nov.), while a herd of about
fifty semi-wild cattle roamed about, most of them descendants
of a number turned out here in '88, when the settlement at
Nankauri was given up. They suffer but little loss in numbers
at the hands of the natives, for the Government allows no guns
in the islands, and it is only very occasionally that a number
of men will combine and slaughter a beast with spears.</p>

<p>From the interior the scene was very beautiful; rolling
grassy downs were dotted with numerous dwarf pandanus
trees (<i>P. furcatus</i>), amongst which the cattle, black, white, and
brown, moved slowly. All around was thick jungle, through
breaks in which the sea was visible on either hand, and in
the west, the sun, shining from behind a dark cloud, painted the
hills and harbour of Nankauri in tones of grey and gold. The
photographs which I took of this scenery were spoilt, thanks to
a liberty taken by the too inquisitive Chinese "boy," who privately
satisfied his curiosity as to the appearance of the plates before
they had been removed from the slides and developed.</p>

<p>In the evening the Government Agent, who is a native of
India, came across from the harbour and brought the Port Register,
in which we entered our arrival. These registers, bound in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
heavy brown leather, stamped with the arms of the Indian
Government, we were often to meet with in future; one is in
the possession of nearly every coast village except those of
Great Nicobar, and some of the remarks in them are very
interesting; others are equally amusing, as when some <i>Nakodah</i>,
vain of his proficiency in English, tries to express himself in
that language, to the utter bepuzzlement of any one who may
come after and see what has been written.</p>

<p>In crossing the island next day, I stampeded the cattle, who
are rather shy of any moving object, although later I was able
to crawl to within five or six yards of the herd, thus learning
how simple a matter it would be for the natives to exterminate
it. In the interior there are several deep ditches of running
water leading into small swamps where the cattle drink. The
shore on the eastern side is formed in places by small bluffs of
clay marl, above which can be traced the overlying beds of
coral.</p>

<p>That afternoon, while preparing specimens, we received a
visit from a swarthy gentleman in a suit of white drill&mdash;the
trousers "a world too <i>long</i>," gracefully falling in concertina-like
folds about his naked ankles. He saluted us gravely, and
tendered a small pocket-book. "What is your name?" said we.
"You will find it," said our dignified visitor, "in the book." So
the book was referred to, and he stood revealed as Captain
Tanamara, Headman of Malacca, recommended by Mr E. H.
Man,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> as intelligent and willing to be useful to whoever should
stop at Nankauri Harbour. He is certainly more ingenious
than the majority of the natives, and speaks English, Hindustani,
a little Burmese, Kar Nicobarese, and Malay, which last indeed
is known by most of the people from here southwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The population, he told us, was decreasing: formerly each
house was occupied by a number of people, as is still the
condition of things in Kar Nicobar, but now there are at most
three or four to a hut.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He and many other men have no
children, the usual number of which is but one or two in each
family. Occasional polygamy and easy arrangements for
divorce prevail here, and the custom of the husband residing at
his wife's house is also in vogue, but in the case of an influential
man, or a headman, it is otherwise. He was much interested
in a kingfisher (<i>H. occiputalis</i>) that was being skinned, and
begged for the eyes, which, he said, formed a valuable specific
in cases of sleeplessness!</p>

<p>One of the most attractive features of the Nicobars is the
existence of a wild inland tribe&mdash;the Shom Pe&#7749;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>&mdash;in the interior
of the southern island. These people are known by reputation
all over the group, and seem to fill the part of a national
"bogey man." From Tanamara, who has visited Great Nicobar
in the station steamer, we obtained a few details. He had
never seen them, and owned with much candour that he was
"plenty 'fraid," and for that reason did not go on shore. He
told us, however, that they are similar in appearance to the
Nicobarese, but wear garments of rattan and bark only. They
are friendly until they see any article belonging to the coast
people which they may covet, and then a raid is made, and
murder generally ensues in getting possession of it.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The abandoned condition of the houses near which we
landed was caused by a death which took place in one of
them a short time previously. This was followed by immediate
desertion, which, however, is only temporary. Everything going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
on seemed to have suddenly stopped; <i>d&aacute;os</i> were lying on
the floor, clothes hung from pegs in the walls, food, half-cooked,
still stood in the pots. The animals wandered about uncared-for,
cats and dogs in a very famished condition.</p>

<p>Inside this house was quite a small museum: there were
large figures, daubed with red and black paint, of men and
women with eyes of pearl shell, Polynesian fashion, and
drapings of palm leaf and cotton; smaller images and various
grotesque heads, sharks, birds, and crocodiles, all carefully carved,
and painted in red and blue; painted turtle skulls by the
dozen. Spears, cross-bows, and water-vessels hung from the
walls, with boards on which were human figures, pigs, fish,
fowls, and palm trees, all very well drawn, and not conventionalised
in design. On a shelf above the fireplace were piles
of wooden plates, dishes, and food-baskets, and below them the
big Chaura pots were standing on blocks of stone above the
ashes.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>We only obtained one megapode on Trinkat, and it was
found in a trap. They are probably numerous, for we saw
several, and heard frequent calls. The undergrowth is very
thick, and the ground covered with tall grass, and although to
move about is easy, it is not easy to see these birds until one
is almost upon them, when they disappear before one can get a
shot. A few rats (<i>Mus burrus</i>, sp. nov.) were caught in the
traps, and we shot a few additional specimens, and this is the
only island we visited in the Nicobars where they seemed
other than extremely scarce.</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">On</span> the morning of the 5th we weighed anchor, and proceeded
to Nankauri harbour. The entrance is about a quarter of a
mile wide, and its northern coast, once the site of the Government
settlement, is the only open grassy portion of the harbour shores.
Just within the point stands the flag-staff, and above it, on the
crest of a low hill, a little graveyard lies within the shade of casuarinas.
A long jetty of coral blocks runs out from the shore, and
near by is the house of the agent. Opposite, on either side of
Mayo Point, are the villages of Malacca and In&uacute;anga, and behind
them the forest-clad slopes stretch to grassy uplands.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/fp078.jpg" width="640" height="473" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">IN&Uacute;ANGA VILLAGE, NANKAURI HARBOUR.</span>
</div>

<p>We sailed into Spiteful Bay, which lies just behind the
southern point of the harbour entrance, and anchored in 12
fathoms, mud and sand, close to a little village of a dozen houses
standing above the beach.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In front of these and planted in
shallow water, rose a number of tall poles, each made of several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
spars bound end to end with rattan, and ornamented at intervals
with bunches of palm leaves. These the natives call <i>kanaia</i>:
they have, we were told repeatedly, no superstitious significance;
one is put up for each inhabited house in the village, and
renewed periodically.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Landing at the village (<i>matai</i>) is easy, for below the water-level
the sandy shore slopes downwards at an angle of 45&deg;, a
condition made possible by the tranquility of the harbour water.
The houses, (<i>n'gi</i>) are less solidly built than those of Kar
Nicobar, possess a small side-wall about 4 feet high, of boards,
and a pointed finial crowning the conical roof; but do not have
the protective discs on the supports: the door, too, and a number
of small windows open in the sides, and the latter are all supplied
with shutters that swing freely on a wooden hinge.</p>

<p>A new and very large canoe was lying on the beach, the
dug-out portion, without additions, measuring 42 feet long by
3 feet wide and 3 feet deep. The hull was charred, and decorated
by grooved bands running at short intervals from gunwale to
gunwale round the outside. Canoes are fitted, according to
size, with from one to four short bamboo masts, each supported
by four wide-spreading stays of rattan, and on these are hoisted
lateen sails with a short tack of about 12 inches, made of cotton
or pandanus leaves. The masts are never stepped on the floor
of the canoe, but always on one of the crossbars or thwarts.</p>

<p>The people about the village were feeding their dogs and
pigs with a kind of gruel in wooden troughs, and as the animals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
were judged to have enough, each was smacked on the head
and sent off; no greediness nor crowding was allowed, and the
pigs were far better behaved than the generality of their species.</p>

<p>We found the jungle near the houses quite impracticable,
both from its tangled nature and the steepness of the ground
it covered. A walk along the shore produced only a whimbrel
(<i>Numenius ph&#339;opus</i>), which, although not bad for the pot, is
too wide-spread a species to be of much value ornithologically.</p>

<p>Experiences next day on the opposite side of the bay were
little more encouraging. Scrambling up a steep hill, we found
a small stretch of flat land on the top, where ran one or two
faint paths, along which the traps were placed. Birds were
very scarce, and as it began to rain, we returned to the dinghy,
and rowed round the bay, looking for kingfishers. The boat
was paddled up all the creeks in the thick belt of mangroves
that fringe the shores, but there was no sign of the bird we were
after&mdash;the large stork-billed <i>Pelargopsis</i>&mdash;and we had to be
content with whimbrels. The creeks, which in many cases are
only just broad enough to row in, often wind for long distances
among the mangroves, and on a dull day are depressing places,
with but little life in them. In the bay itself we saw many
beautiful branching corals of kinds far too delicate to grow in
the more disturbed water of the sea; much of the growth which
spreads all over the bottom was, however, killed by the mud and
fresh water that comes down through the mangroves.</p>

<span class="caption">NANKAURI CANOE, WITH FESTIVAL DECORATIONS.</span>
</div>

<p>Our arrival in the harbour was coincident with the beginning
of a feast, which was to continue for a week or so. Two new
canoes, decked with most gorgeous banners, flags, and streamers
flying from small poles,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> were launched on the first day, and,
to an accompaniment of singing, rowed across to the northern
shore to obtain young coconuts for the coming festivity. These
joyous occasions the natives call, in imitation of our English
custom, "making Christmas"; and over the door of those houses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
where the gatherings are held they fasten a number of branches.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
We entered one of the houses thus decorated. Outside were
large heaps of green coconuts, and inside other refreshment in
the shape of several big jars of toddy; the interior was prepared
for dancing. Immense quantities of cotton print, of every
pattern and colour imaginable, were hung from rattans crossing
the upper portion of the roof to within about 7 feet
from the floor; the upper part was a nearly solid mass of cotton.
On a framework in the centre of the floor, covered with alternate
strips of red and white cotton, so that it seemed to be made
of barbers' poles, were suspended a large number of spoons,
forks, and soup-ladles. Everything else in the house was pushed
back against the walls in order that the floor might be clear,
and as the place was rather dark, it was illuminated by a lamp
made from half a coconut-shell, containing melted pigs' fat and
a strip of rag. The spoons and forks, in which the natives
invest nearly all they obtain by the sale of their coconuts,
are purchased from the Burmese and Indian traders. For
soup-ladles they give 20 rupees; table-spoons 10 rupees, and
smaller sizes 5 rupees. They are of electro-plate and German
metal, but the people apparently think them silver, and did
not seem to believe us when we told them otherwise, so we
did not press the point. Considering the large number they
possess, the knowledge might be painful, and since they are
destroyed at the owner's death, it perhaps does not matter much.
"It's an ill wind that blows nobody good," and the traders
ought to do very well at such prices.</p>

<p>The large public dances of the northern island are not held
here, but two or three private houses are prepared for the
occasion as above described.</p>

<p>The people of these islands employ in everyday life far more
clothing than the Kar Nicobarese, and a great proportion of
them wear some other garment&mdash;trousers or jacket&mdash;in addition
to their national apparel. Formerly, they wore the white palm-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>leaf
head-dress, but it was given up when imported garments
became common.</p>

<p>A custom of partially exhuming the bodies of the dead exists
here, and whenever celebrated is the occasion of a special feast
(<i>Koru&acirc;k</i>). In the Northern Islands the entire remains are disinterred,
carefully cleaned, wrapped up once more, and reburied;
here, the skull and jawbone only are retained.</p>

<p>The local population greatly deprecates the method of their
northern countrymen.</p>

<p>It would appear, by the way, that the present custom is no
degradation of the past, for more than a century ago the head
only was disinterred and cleansed.</p>

<span class="caption">KITCHEN AND DWELLING-HOUSE, WITH FESTIVAL TREE, NANKAURI.</span>
</div>


<div class="sblockquot"><p>"On the anniversary of the festival&mdash;if it can be so called&mdash;their
houses are decorated with garlands of flowers, fruit, and
branches of trees. The people of each village assemble, dressed
in their best attire, at the principal house in the place, where
they spend the day in a convivial manner. The men sitting
apart from the women, smoke tobacco and intoxicate themselves,
while the latter are nursing the children, and employed
in preparation for the mournful business of the night. At
a certain hour of the afternoon, announced by striking the
<i>goung</i> (an instrument of brass somewhat like the <i>gurry</i> of
Bengal&mdash;it sounds more hollow), the women set up the most
dismal howls and lamentations, which they continue without
intermission till about sunset, when the whole party gets up
and walks in procession to the burying-ground. Arrived at
the place, they form a circle round one of the graves, when a
stake, planted exactly over the head of a corpse, is pulled up.
The woman who is nearest of kin to the deceased steps out
from the crowd, digs up the skull and draws it up in her hands.
(The office is always performed by the women, whichever sex
the skull belongs to. A man in a fantastic garb officiates as
priest.) At sight of the bones her strength seems to fail her;
she shrieks, she sobs, and tears of anguish abundantly fall on
the mouldering object of her pious care. She cleans it from
the earth, scrapes off the festering flesh, and laves it plentifully
with the milk of fresh coconuts, supplied by the bystanders;
after which, she rubs it over with an infusion of saffron, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
wraps it carefully up in a piece of new cloth. It is then
deposited in the earth, and covered up; the stake is replanted,
and hung with the various trappings and implements belonging
to the deceased. They proceed then to the other graves; and
the whole night is spent in repetitions of these dismal and
disgustful rites.</p>

<p>"On the morning following, the ceremony is concluded by an
offering of many fat swine, when the sacrifice made to the dead
affords an ample feast to the living: they besmear themselves
with the blood of the slaughtered hogs; and some, more voracious
than others, eat the flesh raw."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p>A few hundred yards from the houses in the bay, and on
the seaward side of the same point, is situated the larger
village where the headman resides; the path connecting the
two crosses the site of one of the old Moravian mission establishments,
where the brick foundations of some of the buildings
once standing there may yet be seen.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>This larger village<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> contains fifteen to twenty houses closely
packed together, and fronted by a tall row of <i>kanaia</i> standing
in the water. Bamboo posts, too, split at the upper end and
spread out fanwise, are planted at intervals along the beach;
they are put up yearly by every man in the village, to keep
fever and devils (<i>iwi</i>) away; and several grotesque figures of
crocodiles (<i>y&eacute;o</i>), placed in little shelters, raised on poles, prevent
their living counterparts from attacking the villagers when
they enter the water.</p>

<p>The houses are of two kinds, round and rectangular; the
latter are used as kitchens and storerooms, but there is a fireplace
in the others, where much of the cooking is done. The conical
roofs are made of attaps of nipah palm, neatly fastened to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
framework of thick rattan by lashings of cane, the sides and
floor are generally of roughly-hewn boards; inside, about 3
feet from the wall, a circle of posts helps to support the roof,
which, in some cases, is entirely lined with horizontal laths of
wood. The apex is crowned outside by a high, carved finial.
Access is obtained by means of a notched pole, and to permit
the entrance of domestic animals, a tree trunk, split and hollowed
out to form a trough, slopes gently up from the ground to door
or window. Beneath the houses are platforms on which the
natives keep their store of pandanus and coconuts, their spare
pots and baskets, and peculiar bundles of wood. This latter is
neatly cut into billets about 1 foot long, and packed into circular
bundles, 2 or 3 feet in diameter, by means of a tight lashing
of cane.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>One afternoon we paid a visit to Tanamara. He and his wife
have no children, but have adopted a little girl from Chaura,
whose parents are dead. This custom of adoption is, he says,
not at all uncommon. Tanamara's father and mother live with
him; the former, "England" by name, is an old, white-headed
man, who is nearly eighty; he professes to know nothing
about the piratical atrocities which formerly occurred in this
group of islands, although many of them happened at a period
sufficiently late in his life for him to have fully comprehended
such events.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/fp084.jpg" width="415" height="616" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">TANAMARA'S "KAREAU."</span>
</div>

<p>The interior and contents of the house were very similar to
what we had already seen in Trinkat. Opposite the door stood
the fireplace&mdash;a bed of clay on the floor&mdash;above which was a
mantle-shelf or rack, where are kept pots, baskets, trays, etc. A
grated floor formed a small chamber immediately under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
roof, where baskets and odds-and-ends are stowed away. Several
boxes, packed with the family possessions of cotton and spoons,
stood against the walls, on which hung various charms&mdash;small
figures (<i>kareau</i>), carved scrolls, tassels of palm leaf, and pigs' skulls&mdash;all
for scaring away devils. Hanging in the centre was a grass
string, with a few small coconuts attached: these are for the
purpose of feeding the house, and are periodically renewed: the
object so nourished does not seem possessed of much acumen,
however, for small green nuts, which have been blown down or
have fallen from disease, seem quite good enough to sustain it.
The house also contained some almost life-sized human figures
(<i>odiau</i>), carved from wood, painted and clothed. These were
not at all badly shaped, and show an appreciation of anatomical
detail unusual among uncivilised people. The shape of the
Nicobarese head, and the peculiar angle at which the teeth are
set, were well noticed: the swelling muscles, the toes and fingers,
even the sharpness of the shin-bone in front of the leg, and the
form of the knee-cap, were faithfully copied. They were all
supplied with a piece of rancid pork hung from the neck or
placed in the mouth.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Several pictures (<i>hent&aacute;</i>) drawn on slabs of wood were placed
against the walls. These originate from an attack of fever.
They are drawn by the village artist by order of the doctor
(<i>menl&uacute;ana</i>), who tells him what he should make. The latter
is paid in kind for his work. Of frequent occurrence are
pigs, crocodiles and coconut trees, whilst almost always there
appears a scene of men seated at a table and drinking
rum from large glasses. If the patient make a good recovery,
the picture is kept as a potent charm, since it has been
successful in scaring away the spirits of illness; otherwise, it is
thrown away. A bird (<i>kal&aacute;ng</i>)<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> commonly made during fever
will also produce recovery.</p>

<p>We could not persuade the people to part with any of these,
neither would they sell one of the large figures. Tanamara has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a life-sized statue, painted black, with a white face, and although
he was offered in exchange a dress-suit and a white sun-helmet,
which he much coveted, he would not part with his double: its
price was far above rupees. I was, however, permitted to
photograph both pictures and figure; although, while the latter
was being moved from the house to the beach, he was in an
agony of apprehension, for he believes that if any accident should
happen to it, illness on his part would follow, while, had we
broken it or taken it away, he himself would certainly die. The
object of these figures is to keep devils from working harm to
their owners. Some people have none, while others sometimes
possess two or more.</p>

<p>"<i>February 7.</i>&mdash;The people are far too occupied with their
feasting to take much notice of our presence: on shore I found
them so busy and excited that the photographs I had hoped
for could not be obtained. Every day four large canoes go
across to the other side of the harbour for coconuts, of which
very few grow about the village: all the vessels are gaily
decorated, and the paddlers are in holiday attire&mdash;collars of
split banana leaf (<i>f&#363;m</i>), beads, new cottons, and red paint on
their noses.</p>

<p>"Tanamara came on board to tell us that the dance, at which
by arrangement we are to be spectators, will be ready to-morrow
morning; but that, to give a proper dance, the performers
require to be jolly, and to be jolly needs a bottle of rum, which
under the circumstances it was our duty to supply. He only
stopped to beg for a glass of spirits, and then returned to the
amusements on shore. Laughter, cheers, and singing have been
going on in the village all the evening."</p>

<span class="caption">NANKAURI MAN WITH DANCING COLLAR AND PAINTED NOSE.</span>
</div>

<p>"<i>February 8.</i>&mdash;About nine o'clock this morning, taking with
us a supply of liquid&mdash;half water, half rum&mdash;we landed at
the village, and were received with a cordiality which doubtless
owed its warmth partly to the presence of the bottles. In the
banqueting-house we found dancing still in progress, that,
judging from the noise made, had lasted throughout the night.
All the cottons had been taken down, but the stand of spoons<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
still remained in the centre of the floor. Every one still on
his legs was very hilarious; we were shown large jars which
last evening were full of toddy. Lying about the sides of the
floor people were sleeping, some from sheer weariness, some
from intoxication. All were gaily dressed; bright cottons hung
from the shoulders like a cloak, round the neck were strings of
beads and collars of frilled banana-leaf, now faded; many
wore ear-stretchers of red and white cotton made into rosettes,
and the men were crowned with chaplets of twisted print: we
saw several handsome belts, made of silver wire and rupees
(almost the only use to which money is put), and some wore
armlets of silver not unlike those brass-wire ornaments affected
by Dyak women.</p>

<p>"In dancing, the people&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;form a
circle, or portion of a circle, round the spoons, and, with arms
intertwined and hands on each others' shoulders, move slowly
towards the right, with measured step, to the accompaniment
of general chanting&mdash;to me it sounded like 'ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
ah, ah,' <i>ad infinitum</i>, only varied in tone and rhythm.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The
regularity of the movement is broken at intervals by a step or
two in the opposite direction, or a pause with a pirouette on
one leg, and now and then a heavy stamp on the floor. One
old woman, who danced most perseveringly, was so intoxicated,
that, whenever her neighbours took away the support of their
arms, she fell over, and was too helpless to rise unaided.</p>

<p>"Seated on boxes we watched the performance, and the doctor,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>presiding over the rum bottles, repeatedly filled a small glass,
from which each imbibed, turn and turn about. At our feet
squatted a number of half-drunken people, gabbling away in a
mixture of Nicobarese, Malay, and English; not all so stupid,
however, that some could not detect the water in the tipple.</p>

<p>"Tanamara, who was fairly clear-headed at first, received
the finishing touch from the rum, and before we left embraced
Abbott with fervent gratitude: 'You good man, I love you;
you make us all nice and drunk. Oh, I feel so nice!'</p>

<p>"The dancing was very monotonous, and before long we
were glad to get out to the open air: the hut was ventilated
by a small doorway only, and the vitiated atmosphere in
which people had been moving for the last twelve hours was
by no means pleasant. Children and boys were present, but
no young women; in fact, at all times we only caught sight
of the latter as they bolted into the houses on our approach,
and none were forthcoming for the camera."</p>

<p>"<i>February 9.</i>&mdash;Everything is quiet on shore to-day after
the dissipation which left off yesterday. Tanamara came on
board with a headache; he was sure it could be cured with
rum, but got a heavy dose of Eno instead. We gave him a
few ducks he was very anxious to possess. It is to be hoped
there is a drake among them&mdash;a point that was somewhat
doubtful&mdash;for then we shall have benefited the community to
the extent at least of introducing a new domestic animal to
the islands."</p>

<p>"<i>February 10.</i>&mdash;Gave Tanamara a watch this afternoon, to
spur him to further efforts in collecting curiosities. His wife,
whom he calls 'my Mary,'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> desires to visit the schooner this
evening; but although she is uninvited, and comes by her own
wish, she has bargained for two fathoms of red cotton in payment
for the honour done us.</p>

<span class="caption">GROUP OF DANCERS, NANKAURI HARBOUR.</span>
</div>

<p>"We met a man on shore who was for a time at the school
formerly kept for natives at Port Blair. He lays claim to the
name of William Brown, and speaks English very well; his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
education otherwise has resulted in giving him a contempt for
the native superstitions, of which he speaks with sneers, and
meanwhile has replaced them by no other tenets. The train
of events that brings such a condition of things about seems
somewhat injudicious. A knowledge&mdash;a small knowledge&mdash;of the
'three R's' is of very little use to a native who has sooner or
later to return to his national mode of existence. His experience
may unsettle him, and is no suitable training for his future
life, while it must leave him at a disadvantage among his
countrymen, who have been bred to the conditions under which
their existence will be passed."</p>

<p>"<i>February 11.</i>&mdash;Tanamara came on board last evening with
his brother-in-law (Ham&oacute;l) and nephew (T&eacute;rrok). He was half-drunk
with toddy, and brought&mdash;it was quite a family party&mdash;his
wife (Helpak) and mother (Mert). A canoe-load of dishes,
spears, and charms, which accompanied them, we purchased
with old clothes, wire, and rice. The headman is as great a
beggar as the others, perhaps more so, by virtue of his position
and his English. Our conversation was continually interrupted
by demands for one thing or another as he remembered them:
things for his father, mother, wife, each request insinuatingly
prefaced by the words 'my friend.' 'My friend, you give me&mdash;;
My friend, I want&mdash;.' But for this fault, he is a fairly favourable
specimen of a Nicobarese, and is certainly more intelligent than
the rank and file; but, like many that we met, he is somewhat
spoilt by contact with more civilised conditions.</p>

<p>"We had on board a quantity of American cigarettes, packed
in cardboard boxes, each containing a dozen, and a coloured
picture of a young woman in an evening gown! These packets
were very useful as small presents, or as an answer to a
request for a smoke. 'Oh, my dear!' exclaimed Tanamara, as
he lovingly gazed at the picture from his packet. But he soon
became dissatisfied, for she was a blonde and he likes brunettes,
while what he was most anxious to obtain was the portrait of
a Malay woman.</p>

<p>"Our small supply of spirits coming to an end, Abbott<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
manufactured a new kind of cocktail from the medical stores&mdash;tincture
of cardamoms, essence of ginger, sugar, and water, with
a few spoonsful of rum to give the mixture a bouquet. This
fiery liquid was received with some suspicion at first;
but when I told them it was the favourite tipple of the C.C.
at Port Blair (may I be forgiven), Tanamara and his brother&mdash;it
was too stiff for the others&mdash;drank it down, although the
tears stood in their eyes."</p>

<p>Of the fauna, we obtained from day to day little of interest:
the jungle was without paths, and too thick even to see much
in. No rats were trapped, but one specimen was brought us
in a bottle by a native, and this has proved to be <i>Mus alexandrinus</i>,
totally unrecorded until now from the Andamans
or Nicobars. Pigeons were common, but megapodes scarce,
and the only one obtained was caught in a trap. The
vicinity of the harbour, though a somewhat unproductive
hunting-ground for the ornithologist, for those interested in the
natives, is, like Kar Nicobar, a most satisfactory locality.</p>

<p>Nankauri is a heart-shaped island, with an area of 19 square
miles, and a maximum height of 534 feet. The bed rock consists
of serpentinous magnesian, which is exposed in places. It
is covered by a plastic white or yellowish clay and clay marl,
with intervening beds of quartz sandstone, formed, like the
clay, by the disintegration of the plutonic rock. The clay beds
are similar to those which cover most of the northern islands,
and contain silica, alumina, magnesia, and iron, but usually no
lime, except in the form of gypsum, found in crevices. Portions
of the clay cliffs exposed to the sun are covered with a fine
efflorescence of sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salts). Professor
Ehrenberg found in 1850, on examining specimens sent him
by Dr Rink (<i>Galathea</i> Expedition), that this formation is a
polycistina clay similar to that of Barbadoes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 191px;">
<img src="images/fp090.jpg" width="191" height="600" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">NANKAURI MAN WITH SILVER NECKLACE.</span>
</div>

<p>About one-third of the island is covered with grass: a belt
of forest runs all round the coast, but in the interior is restricted
to the valleys and more sheltered slopes. The most useful
species are: <i>Garcinias</i>, <i>Calophyllums</i>, <i>Myristica irya</i>, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
yields good timber; <i>Sterculia campanulata</i> and <i>Terminalia procera</i>,
which grow to immense sizes. The Nicobar and many other
palms occur in numbers, and a wild species of cinnamon is
common, as also is <i>Amomum fenzlii</i>, the leaves of which are
used for cigarette wrappings, and the fruit much eaten by the
natives.</p>

<p>But little fruit is grown about the villages: limes, guavas,
and soursops are commonest. In the way of supplies, coconuts,
pigs, and a few fowls might be obtained from the natives,
and beef by shooting the wild cattle. Water in the harbour
is very bad, and scarce.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>By a comparison of the census returns (1886 and 1901), the
population would seem to have been stationary for many years:
it now consists of 224 individuals.</p>

<p>The central group of islands was once notorious for the
frequent disasters occurring to vessels calling there. It was
for long thought that the numerous total losses that occurred
in the Bengal Sea were due to storms and cyclones; but at
length the discovery was made, that, from the beginning of the
century until the British occupation, the vicinity of Nankauri
Harbour was the <i>habitat</i> of a band of pirates, who cut off and
murdered the crews of many vessels calling to trade and supply
themselves with water or provisions. The headquarters of the
band appear to have been in Expedition Harbour, and from
there, whenever a vessel anchored at the islands, they sallied
out, and either getting on board under the guise of peaceful
natives, took the crews by surprise with a sudden attack, or else
cut up landing-parties, and then captured the weakened vessel.</p>

<p>In this way, always by treachery and never in open warfare,
they succeeded in capturing ship after ship.</p>

<p>There is some ground for belief that, for a time, the piratical
goings-on were carried out under the leadership of an Englishman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
named William Worthington. The dates given in the various
accounts of him are contradictory; but it appears that, about 1808,
Worthington deserted at Nankauri from the frigate <i>Bucephalus</i>,
and that for some years subsequently the pirates were directed
by a man who gave that name as his.</p>

<p>In 1814, the <i>Ceres</i> was boarded by an Englishman, who stated
that he had been left behind by a man-of-war. After inspecting
the vessel, he left, and next day, as the anchor was being hove
up, he arrived at the head of about thirty canoes, and made a
futile attack on the ship.</p>

<p>A short time after, the brig <i>Hope</i> was cut off. An Englishman,
who had previously stated he was Worthington, deserter
from the <i>Bucephalus</i>, murdered the captain and mate, and the
natives despatched the crew, with the exception of two or three,
who escaped in a boat and in some way arrived at Rangoon.</p>

<p>At length Worthington was either expelled from the harbour,
or left with some home-going Bompokans; but be that as it may,
a man of that name lived for some years on Teressa and Bompoka,
where several captains met with, or received letters from, him.
Their opinions of his character differed. He was last seen in
December 1820, when he reported that a ship from Bengal had
been cut off and massacred at Nankauri, with several others
previously, by natives led by Kafirs. He stated that after he
deserted at Nankauri, he was unable to leave until he had paid
a ransom to the natives. His death took place the same year,
and the natives with whom he lived afterwards gave him the
best of characters: that "John," as they called him, had long
dwelt quietly and amicably amongst them. His seems to have
thus been a case of "devil turned monk," and his career amongst
the natives akin to the records of the better-known "beach-combers"
of the early days in the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>In a paper contributed to the <i>Journal of the Indian Archipelago</i>,
1847, the missionary, Chopard, says that silver had a peculiar
attraction for the natives, and was the chief article which induced
them to butcher, by treachery always, crews of vessels calling at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
the harbour. He knew a Kamortan, thirty-five years of age,
who recollected eight vessels which had been cut off there in that
manner.</p>

<p>In 1833, a Cholia vessel was cut off in the false harbour of
Nankauri (Expedition Harbour) and everyone murdered. In 1844,
Captain Ignatius Ventura, from Moulmein, commanding the <i>Mary</i>,
anchored on the north side of Teressa at two o'clock, and an hour
later he and his crew were murdered. In the same year, Captain
Law met the same fate on Kamorta. In 1845, a vessel, having
taken in part of her cargo at Kachal, sailed to the false harbour
at Nankauri to complete, and all hands were murdered.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>"While I was at Kar Nicobar," Captain Gardner writes in
1857,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> "two vessels were cut off at Nankauri, the crews massacred,
and the ships plundered and scuttled." In 1840, the <i>Pilot</i>, South
Sea whaler, was cut off there, and the captain, mates, and twenty-five
men murdered; the third mate, surgeon, and seven men
escaped to sea in a boat.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> In 1844, the cutter <i>Emilia</i> visited
Nankauri, and her captain was murdered within an hour of
landing, but the boat escaped.</p>

<p>Piracy in the Nicobars came to an end with the occupation
of Nankauri Harbour by the Indian Government in 1869; but
two years previous to that it had been necessary to send there a
British punitive expedition, on account of the atrocities committed
by the natives. A notification of the event was made by
Captain N. B. Bedingfield, who commanded the expedition, in
the first of the Port Registers entrusted to the Nankauri natives.</p>


<div class="sblockquot">

<p class="center">"TO ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN.</p>

<p class="noidt">"<span class="smcap">Whereas</span> the natives of these islands have been guilty of
several acts of piracy; the crews of no less than four vessels
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>have been massacred; a white woman and two children have
been kept prisoners for about two years and a half, and after
being most cruelly treated, the poor woman, used for the very
vilest purposes, was, with her children, first poisoned and afterwards
knocked on the head: Her Majesty's ships <i>Wasp</i> and
<i>Satellite</i> were sent to endeavour to liberate any captives that
might still remain on the Islands, and to punish the natives for
their crimes.</p>

<p>"Several towns implicated have been burnt, all the war canoes
destroyed, and other punishments inflicted ..." etc., etc.</p></div>

<p>Nor was this the only case of the kind, for although most
of the vessels disposed of were native, the total included not a
few European. There is another instance on record, in which
a European woman was taken ashore and so brutally abused
by the band of pirates that she died next day.</p>

<p>It is believed that the origination of these practices cannot
be traced to the natives, but is due to the settlement of a body
of Malays, who attracted a number of the inhabitants to themselves,
and then formed a gang to plunder all vessels calling
at the harbour, consequent upon a successful massacre of the
crew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>KAMORTA</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">The Old Settlement&mdash;The Cemetery&mdash;F. A. de R&ouml;epstorff&mdash;Mortality&mdash;Birds&mdash;The
Harbour&mdash;Appearance of Kamorta&mdash;Dring Harbour&mdash;Olta-m&ouml;it&mdash;Buffalo&mdash;Spirit
Traffic&mdash;Cookery&mdash;Ceremonial Dress&mdash;A Visit from
Tanamara&mdash;Geology&mdash;Flora&mdash;Topography&mdash;Population&mdash;Hamilton's
Description.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">On</span> several occasions we crossed the harbour and visited the
locality of the convict settlement formerly established on Kamorta,
but given up in 1888, when the buildings were dismantled, and
sepoys and prisoners withdrawn to Port Blair.</p>

<p>The jetty on which one lands is more than a hundred yards
long, and although solidly constructed of coral blocks, is now
in need of partial repair. To the right is a long sea-wall, and
on the other hand a small boat harbour, both built of coral.
Beyond the agent's house at the foot of the jetty, one walks
along a grass-grown road shaded by an avenue of tall casuarinas,
and passes several large wells of strong brickwork, and a
large tank for rain water, with various other traces of past
occupation, till on the hill-top one comes on the remains of
the Government bungalow, of which only the foundations are
now to be seen. A little farther on is the only building now
standing&mdash;the old powder store&mdash;"where nothing's here that's
worth defence, they <i>leave</i> a magazine!"</p>

<p>On another hill close by&mdash;from which are to be seen the
whole stretch of the beautiful harbour, the distant forest-clad
slopes of Kachal and the grassy interior of Kamorta&mdash;lies the
little cemetery with its two occupants&mdash;Nicolas Shimmings,
chief engineer of the R.I.M.S. <i>Kwangtung</i>, and Frederick Adolph<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
de R&ouml;epstorff, a Dane by nationality, and for some time superintendent
of the settlement. Tanamara told us of his death, which
occurred in 1883. Complaint had been made that one of
the sepoys of the small force stationed here was in the habit
of stealing the natives' coconuts; him the superintendent reprimanded,
and threatened to send to Port Blair for punishment.
Next day the sepoy shot at and wounded de R&ouml;epstorff while
the latter was in the act of mounting a horse. The injured
man despatched a letter to the Andamans by a Burmese trader,
but died before the arrival of a steamer, five days later. He
was nursed and buried by the Nicobarese, who would not allow
the Indian servants to approach him.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> "He was," said Tanamara,
"a good man, a very good man." He took much interest in
all that surrounded him, and besides contributing accounts of
the Andamans and Nicobars to the journals of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal, he made large collections of lepidoptera for
the Calcutta Museum, and compiled vocabularies of several
of the local languages.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Nowadays,
all that marks our possession of these islands
is the Colonial Jack, presided over by a Hindu; all that shows
our past occupation, fallen brickwork, grass-grown roads and
graves: these things, and the result of our contact with the
native inhabitants. In the north, some knowledge of the
English speech, and the beginning of education; here the suppression
of piracy.</p>

<p>The agent told us that in the group people were dying almost
day by day; the cause, from his description, ague and malaria.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
Beyond two or three slight cases of elephantiasis, we ourselves
noticed no symptoms of disease amongst the adults, but the
children nearly all seemed to be suffering from yaws.</p>

<p>The country around the settlement is very undulating, and
covered with long grass growing on a sterile clay. It was
almost lifeless, for we saw little more than wagtails, pipits, and
an occasional button-quail (<i>Turnix albiventris</i> and <i>Excalfactoria</i>,
sp. nov.); but in one of the numerous gullies between the hills
we found a little <i>jheel</i> where formerly paddy had been grown,
and floating on its surface was a small flock of whistling teal
(<i>Dendrocygna javanica</i>). A couple were dropped before they
flew out of range, and next day we met in the same place a
larger number, which all got off scot free; but a falcon (<i>F. peregrinus</i>),
that like ourselves had just made an unsuccessful attack,
was soon reposing in a game-bag, in company with a chestnut
heron (<i>A. cinnomomea</i>), and a redshank.</p>

<p>On February 11th, when we left our anchorage, the breeze
was very light, and bore the schooner slowly through the calm
waters of the harbour as we steered for the western exit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>All around, the shores sloped downward, covered with dense
forest, but now and again the inland hills rose grass-clad above
the tree-tops; on either hand we passed small villages, Ito&euml;
(six houses), and Pachoak (five houses), placed just above the
edge of the water.</p>

<p>The western opening is bold and rocky, but very narrow;
and among the boulders of the shore are several blow-holes,
from which, when the sea rolls on the beach, spouts of water
fly upwards and break into showers of spray.</p>

<p>Outside, the wind was still light, and we tacked along the
coast for some hours before it strengthened. Much of this
side of Kamorta consists of low broken hills with pointed
summits looking like volcanic cones&mdash;a grassy country, varied
by occasional small patches of forest&mdash;while along the shore
low bluffs and stretches of coco palms succeed each other.</p>

<p>Soon we passed the entrance of Expedition Harbour, a deep,
land-locked bight, separated from Nankauri Harbour by a
narrow strip of land; this was the reputed headquarters of
the band of piratical savages who formerly committed so many
depredations in this neighbourhood. Near by, Mount Edgecombe,
of a very volcanic appearance, rises about 400 feet.</p>

<p>This shore seems but little inhabited, for until we reached
our destination at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, we saw only one small village of four
or five houses.</p>

<p>The wind was off the land when we arrived at Dring Harbour,
and since the entrance was narrowed by rocks and reefs projecting
from either side, we lowered all sail and warped in.</p>

<p>The bay is about half a mile square, and the head, which
is slightly wider than the mouth, is bordered by a long sandy
beach, backed by a belt of scrub and palm trees, from a quarter
to half a mile in depth. The other shores are partially formed
by small cliffs, with a thin fringe of jungle, bounding grassy
hills and downs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/fp098.jpg" width="575" height="436" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">DWELLING-HOUSES, DRING HARBOUR, KAMORTA.<br />
(Partially constructed, and complete.)</span>
</div>

<p>The village of Olta-m&ouml;it (fifteen to twenty houses), "Captain
John," headman, lies along the beach, which abuts at the southern
end upon a fair-sized creek leading to a mangrove swamp at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
the back of the houses. Several natives came on board at once,
in expectation of a feed; none spoke English, but all understood
Malay.</p>

<p>The patch of jungle about the village is rather small, and
to reach more necessitated a walk of some miles; we succeeded,
however, in adding to our collection a diminutive serpent-eagle
(<i>Spilornis minimus</i>), and caught sight in the denser jungle of
a fresh variety of a little forest hawk. Specimens were also
obtained of a small bat which has since been named <i>Pipistrellus
camort&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of the harbour has for long been frequented
by descendants of buffaloes, turned loose by the Danes when
they abandoned their settlement at Nankauri. Formerly it is
said that large herds were to be met with in the neighbourhood;
but we learnt, both from the inhabitants and from the
Port Register, that the animals are now becoming very scarce,
and only a few have recently been killed by visitors from the
station gunboat.</p>

<p>I was out after them on two consecutive days. Both had
been preceded by nights of rain, through which tracking was
much facilitated. The country round is very undulating, often
broken by deep gullies, and covered here and there with small
patches of jungle, while everywhere are scattered pandanus
trees, either in clumps or singly. On both occasions I picked
up fresh tracks in the red clayey soil when some distance from
the village, and after following them for several miles lost them
in distant jungle. There seemed to be only two animals in
the neighbourhood&mdash;one very large indeed, and the other of
much smaller size. This decline in numbers is not due to the
natives, who, with their spears only, could cause little destruction,
and who evince no eagerness to pursue.</p>

<p>Tracks of pig were innumerable, and every now and then
a bunch of little quail whirled away from beneath my feet.
Although out by 5 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, I was not early enough; at three
o'clock on a moonlight night one would probably be more
fortunate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1870, chital and sambhar were turned out on Kamorta,
but nothing is now seen of them, except by the natives, who
state that from time to time a few have been perceived here,
and at Trinkat, which they reached by swimming the narrow
channel intervening.</p>

<p>One afternoon was devoted to the exploration of the creek,
which is rather deep at the mouth, and navigable by boat
for several miles; all this distance it is bordered by the usual
wearisome mangrove forest, in which, however, we saw numbers
of parrots, whimbrel, and pigeons.</p>

<p>The proportion of old men among the people of the village
seemed even greater than was the case at Malacca. On the
headman, John, we met with the only case of tattooing found
in the islands&mdash;probably the work of some Burmese trader, for
neither Nicobarese nor Shom Pe&#7749; tattoo or scarify themselves.</p>

<p>A second junk joined that already in the harbour the day
after our arrival, and everybody on shore was soon drunk. The
inference is obvious. The authorities at Port Blair prohibit
the supply of intoxicants to the natives, and whenever they
are found on board trading vessels, spirits are confiscated, and
a small fine levied, in cash or articles of barter to the value of
about a hundred dollars. This, however, is not always a sufficient
deterrent, and on a second conviction, the Chinese skipper is
awarded six months' rigorous imprisonment in the jail at Viper
Island, Port Blair. The spirit is invaluable to the traders in their
dealings with the natives, and is so inexpensive, that they
can afford to risk its loss, since the chance of discovery is
about one in a hundred.</p>

<p>A small feast was held during our visit, for which a number of
pigs were prepared. Torches, made by binding immense palm
leaves together, were set fire to, and the bristles singed off by
fanning the flame on to the animals as they lay on the ground.</p>

<p>"Captain John" was resplendent for the occasion in a
<i>neng</i> and dress-coat, and a friend of his looked very imposing
in an officer's frogged and braided tunic.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>The day before we left we were surprised by the appearance
of Tanamara, who arrived with one companion in a small canoe.
He had declined to come up in the schooner, on the excuse that
fever-devils and other evil spirits were very active in this
locality. He was, he assured us, very sorry for us alone up
here, and had had a dream which resulted in his setting out.
(I am uncharitable enough to think that that dream had something
to do with rum!) He did not wish to be seen by the shore
people, of whom he seemed afraid, for he stayed aboard all
day, and in the evening, when some of them came off to
the ship, left for a time in his canoe. Next morning he
departed at daybreak, that he might not be observed from the
village.</p>

<p>We ourselves made sail a few hours later, with the intention
of visiting Teressa. We took in water at Dring, but the only
supplies obtained were coconuts.</p>

<p>Kamorta is 15 miles long, and of a general width of 4 miles:
it attains in the extreme south-west a height of 735 feet, and
in the centre rises 435 feet, but the average elevation is about 200
feet. It is of the same geological structure as Nankauri, but is
covered with far less forest, and its extensive grassy downs
are dotted with patches of scrub, bracken, and pandani. The
presence of casuarinas high up in the middle of the island is
peculiar. This species as a rule is found only on the coasts,
but here they were planted by the Settlement authorities at the
Government cattle-stations (between 1869-88), as it was found
that this tree delights in the polycistina clay. The neighbourhood
of Dring Harbour is extremely well watered, as nearly each one
of the many gullies has either a stream or pond in it. A
stratum of a sandy nature underlies the surface clay of this
district, and by washing away, causes the latter to fall in, with
the result that a number of curious hollows are formed on the
tops of the rolling hills. This tendency leads to parts of the
downs becoming terraced as if by artificial agency. Some
thirty villages are scattered along its coasts, and the population,
according to the census, has increased, principally by immigration<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
from Chaura and other islands, from 359 in 1886 to 488 at the
present day.</p>

<p>Of the central group of islands, Hamilton writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Ning and Goury are two fine, smooth islands, well inhabited,
and plentifully furnished with several sorts of good fish, hogs,
and poultry; but they have no horses, cows, sheep, nor goats,
nor wild beasts of any sort but monkeys. They have no
rice nor pulse, so that the kernels of coconuts, yams, and potatoes
serve them for bread.</p>

<p>Along the north end of the easternmost of the two islands
are good soundings, from 6 to 10 fathoms sand, about 2 miles
offshore. The people come thronging on board in their canoes,
and bring fowl, cocks; fish, fresh, salted, and dried; yams, the
best I ever tasted; potatoes, parrots, and monkeys, to barter
for old hatchets, sword-blades, and pieces of iron hoops, to make
defensive weapons against their common disturbers and implacable
enemies the Andamaners; and tobacco they are very
greedy for; for a leaf, if pretty large, they will give a cock;
for 3 feet of an iron hoop a large hog, and for 1 foot in length,
a pig. They all speak a little broken Portuguese, but what
religious worship they use I could not learn."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p></div>

<h3>KACHAL AND OTHER ISLANDS</h3>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">For</span> some hours after we left Dring the breeze was very faint,
but at midday a heavy squall with rain overtook us and carried
us onward, so that we were soon sailing along the southern shore
of Teressa.</p>

<p>The island of Bompoka, which lies but a short distance from
its south-east end, is high, with a central tableland, whence the
ground slopes gently downwards in every direction, and is
covered with forest and grass.</p>

<p>Seen from a distance, Teressa looks like two islands, for it
is elevated at either end: the northern part is covered with forest;
the southern end is all grass-land, save for a fringe of scrub and
large coco-palm groves along the coast. This portion of the
shore is very rocky in places, and numerous points of off-lying
reefs project from the water.</p>

<p>A heavy swell was running from the south-west, and rank on
rank of breakers&mdash;10 feet or so in height&mdash;were rolling shorewards,
throwing up clouds of smoke-like foam. It would have
been impossible to land without danger of losing guns, camera,
etc., so we decided not to make the attempt, and therefore
put about for Kachal, with the less regret in that the locality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
did not seem to hold out much promise as a collecting
ground.</p>

<p>There is no harbour on its coasts, for the shores of the island,
which is crescent-shaped, are almost unbroken. We afterwards
heard that, two or three months previously, a Chinese junk, whose
crew all reached the shore, had been wrecked on the reefs fronting
this part of the island.</p>

<p>In their customs, style of architecture, and in the more
general absence of talismans and demon-exorcising regalia, the
people of Teressa and Bompoka are said to resemble those
of Kar Nicobar, but their language possesses great dialectical
variation.</p>

<p>Teressa is 34 square miles in area, and rises in the north
to nearly 900 feet. The bed rock is serpentine, covered with
sandstone, and there is a fringe of recent coralline alluvium round
the shore, while beds of coral on the high land of the interior
indicate upheaval since the formation of the older alluvium.</p>

<p>The soil of the grass-lands is of an igneous clay formation&mdash;magnesian
clay, formed by disintegration of the plutonic rocks,
whose upheaval in two successive stages brought the Nicobars
into existence. Overlying it in many places are the beds of
coral, and to these formations the grassy downs of the island
are confined&mdash;lallang, with occasional screw-pines, a bracken-like
fern (<i>Gleichenia dichotoma</i>), delicate ground orchids, and various
scrubby plants (<i>Kydia calycina</i>), which point to the occurrence of
annual fires. The transition from grass-land to high forest,
which appears on the sandstone, is very sudden.</p>

<p>The graceful Nicobar palm (<i>Ptychoraphis augusta</i>) is common
in the jungle. Whole groves of this beautiful tree fill the moister
ravines, and give a characteristic appearance to the forest.
Nearly equally conspicuous are large numbers of <i>Sterculia
campanulata</i>.</p>

<p>Fruit and vegetables are the same as are found on Kar
Nicobar, with the addition of tobacco, of which several small
fields have been raised from seed imported from the west coast
of India.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>The census returns of 1901 give the population of Teressa as
624, making the number of inhabitants 50 more than in 1886.</p>

<p>Bompoka, having the appearance of a truncated cone, and
634 feet high, is an oblong-shaped island, about 4 square miles in
area, separated from Teressa by a channel 50 fathoms in depth,
and scarcely more than 2 miles wide. Its inhabitants, who number
less than a hundred, and the people of Teressa, have an interesting
legend to account for the formation of the island. Once upon a
time a vessel, having a prince for its captain, visited Teressa,
where he, on landing, was murdered by the inhabitants. His
wife was taken on shore and treated with the greatest respect;
but, since the spot on which her husband's blood was shed was
always before her eyes, she was very miserable. One night,
however, she was advised in a dream, by her mother, to remove
the bloody spot from Teressa if she would be happy. This she
did, and Bompoka was thus separated from that island.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The geological formation and the vegetation are similar to
those of Teressa. The inhabitants have good plantations of
fruit-trees&mdash;papaya, plantains, and limes&mdash;neatly fenced to keep
out the pigs. At Poahat, on the west coast, good water is to be
obtained from a stream at the back of the village.</p>

<p>These two islands, with perhaps Chaura, seem those referred
to by Hamilton as the Somerera Islands, so called because "on
the south end of the largest island is a hill that resembles the
top of an umbrella or somerera. They are fine champaign
ground, and, all but one, well inhabited. The island Somerera
lies about 8 leagues to the northward of Ning and Goury (the
Nankauri group), and is well inhabited for the number of
villages that show themselves as we sail along the shores. The
people, like those of Ning and Goury, are very courteous, and
bring the product of their island aboard of ships to exchange
for commodities. Silver nor gold they neither have nor care
for, so the root of all evil can never send out branches of misery,
or bear fruit to poison their happiness! The men's clothing
is a bit of string round the middle, and about 1&frac12; feet of cloth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
6 inches broad, tucked before and behind, within that line. The
women have a petticoat from the navel to the knee, and their
hair close shaved; but the men have their hair left on the upper
part of the head and below the crown, but cut so short that it
hardly comes to their ears."</p>

<p>Chaura, which lies 7 miles north-westward of Teressa, has
an area of about 3 square miles only. It is generally low, and
the only jungle it possesses is a little at the south end, where
it rises almost perpendicularly in a rocky pinnacle to a height
of about 350 feet, having the appearance, with the contiguous
low portion, of a broad-brimmed hat. It was on this account
termed Sombrero by the Portuguese navigators of the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries, who were probably the first Europeans
to have any commercial dealings with the Nicobarese.</p>

<p>The people are very well off, on account of their trade in
canoes and pottery: but to obtain the articles imported by
the traders, canoe voyages are made to other islands, as the
anchorage at Chaura is exceedingly precarious, and after the native
requirements are provided for there are but few nuts to spare for
trade, so that vessels are hardly ever known to call. The island
is the best cultivated in the group, and besides abounding in
oranges, limes, and other fruit, is covered with coconuts; and
toddy being common, drunkenness is fairly prevalent. One
of the institutions of the place is the door mat; for a large flat
sponge, which is found in numbers on the reefs, is placed at
the bottom of every house-ladder, for the natives to wipe their
feet on!</p>

<p>Although the smallest, it is at the same time the most
densely populated of the islands, for, in spite of decreasing
numbers, which may perhaps be due to emigration, the
people of Chaura number (January 1901) some 522 in all;
in 1886 the population fell only a few short of 700. We were
told that they are taller, more powerful, and darker-skinned
than the other Nicobarese, and also dolichocephalic.</p>

<p>Through an exaggerated reputation for magic, they are
greatly feared throughout the group, and have for this reason<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
developed a most independent and overbearing demeanour.
Various circumstances assist the cultivation of these traits&mdash;the
value in which their canoes<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> are held throughout the
Archipelago, for one; but the most important of all is the
monopoly<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> which the island of Chaura possesses in the manufacture
of pottery.</p>

<p>Throughout the Nicobars there is an inherent belief that
should anyone&mdash;other than a native of Chaura in Chaura&mdash;attempt
to make a vessel of clay, he is doomed to almost
immediate destruction. This fate was formerly supposed to
follow the act of even eating food cooked in any pottery other
than manufactured on the island, but this part of the superstition
is now losing force, and the Nicobarese freely provide
themselves with pots made at Port Blair.</p>

<p>The women of Chaura&mdash;for the men take no part in the
construction of the pots&mdash;cleanse and prepare the clay, by
washing out the rougher particles and kneading it with fine
sand. The operator seats herself on the ground by a slab of
wood, on which she lays a ring of coco-palm pinn&aelig; neatly
bound together. Upon this ring she sets a shallow dish, neatly
lined with a circular piece of plantain leaf. With a lump of
clay, the bottom of the vessel to be constructed is moulded in
the dish, and upon this basis, by means of ropes of clay, the
work is built up, the operator turning the pot round and round,
and shaping it with her eye and hand. The vessel is set aside
on a platform under the hut for a day or so, to dry: only the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
smallest kind can be prepared for the kiln without an interval
of waiting.</p>

<p>The pot when dry is scraped with a shell, and then reversed,
and all superfluous material removed by means of a fine strip of
bamboo moistened with water, while the fingers, also wet, are
gently passed over the inner and outer surfaces in order to
smooth them. The pot is then replaced on the platform for
ten days more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 50%;">
<img src="images/p108.png" width="100%" alt="Chaura Pottery." title="Chaura Pottery." />
<span class="caption">Chaura Pottery.</span>
</div>

<p>The kiln is prepared by sticking bits of broken pottery in
the ground, a few inches apart, and on these the pot is set
upside down. In the space beneath it, a layer of fine wood
ash, and a quantity of coconut-shells and scraps of firewood,
are heaped. A wheel-like object, larger in circumference than
the pot, is placed on its upturned base, and against this rest
sticks of firewood stood on end. When the fire is kindled, two
or three women fan the flame, and with wooden pokers prop
up and replace the fuel. When the vessel is baked, it is removed
with the same implement and placed on dry sand.</p>

<p>Coloured stripes are laid on by means of strips of unripe
coconut husk pressed against the vessel while hot&mdash;the acid
juice turning black the moment it touches the heated surface.
Finally a handful of moist husk is passed over the inner and
outer sides, imparting a light-copper colour to the parts not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
stained by the deeper dye, and the vessels are stored for a
time to season.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The pots vary in size, from a capacity of half a pint to five
gallons or more, and also in shape, some having a perfectly straight
plain lip, while in others the edge is turned out or rounded, but
all are alike in having a more or less rounded base.</p>

<p>After leaving Teressa, we encountered fresh breezes and
squally weather until we anchored in darkness near the shore
of Kachal. At daybreak next morning we weighed, and again
started&mdash;with scarce a breath of wind&mdash;for the bay on the west
coast where we intended to stay.</p>

<p>With Kachal we returned again to the tropical island of
common type in these seas, for it is entirely jungle-covered,
with no traces of grass-land visible.</p>

<p>On account of their geological structure, the Nicobars fall
botanically into two divisions&mdash;the northern islands, including
perhaps Nankauri, are largely covered with grass, with coco
palms and pandani growing in the interior; while the southern
group, consisting of Kachal, with Great and Little Nicobar, are
entirely forest-covered. Tilanchong, although belonging to the
others by position, should nevertheless be classed with the latter
islands.</p>

<p>Several canoes from a small village on the north-west coast
came off to inspect the schooner as we slowly drifted along.
Their occupants seemed less prepossessing than those people
we had just left, for they looked somewhat dirty in person and
were dressed in discarded old clothes, or the cheap cottons
and loose trousers supplied by the Chinese. The Nicobarese
are not so partial to water as the Malays, and they by no
means improve matters by unnecessarily clothing their bodies
with cast-off garments and once gaudy cottons, which they
never, or rarely, dream of washing.</p>

<p>We reached West Bay by midday, and anchored in 2&frac12; fathoms.
A junk was lying farther in, the fourth we had seen. From
the southern shore, coral-reefs project for some distance, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
into the bay and seaward, and at low tide the swell breaks
upon them heavily; while, at the same time, two rocks project
above water inside the harbour, near the north beach, and
must be borne in mind when choosing an anchorage. Fifteen
or sixteen houses, surrounded by coconuts, are scattered along
half a mile of beach, and at its head the bay narrows and then
extends inland among mangroves and their attendant swamps.</p>

<p>Our first expedition was up the bay, which we found opened
out into a shallow lagoon nowhere more than 2 or 3 feet deep.
The dinghy grounded often, and we were unable to reach firm
land anywhere, so thick was the belt of mangroves. Rowing
up some of the small creeks winding among them, we saw
several flocks of herons (<i>Sumatranus javanica</i>), while sandpipers,
curlew and whimbrel were common on the mud-banks, and
pigeons and parrots in the taller trees.</p>

<p>In several places occur those stretches of dead mangroves
only seen when the trees are large, and which are infallible
evidence of the growth of land; for when such trees first took
root, a certain amount of salt water must have been present,
while, when they are found dead, the roots are nearly always
silted up with solid matter, which first causes the water to become
stagnant, and finally replaces it. Having served their purpose,
they die, and stand white and gaunt until brought down by
the wind or gradual decay.</p>

<p>At sunset, large flocks of whimbrel, travelling seaward down
the mouth of the lagoon, afforded some fair shooting, for they
were very wild, and flew past us at an amazing pace as we fired
at them from the boat hidden in the mangroves.</p>

<p>On the northern side of the bay, where much of our collecting
was done, we found, behind the houses, a number of paths leading
among coconut and pandanus palms, tangled grass, and bushes.
Beyond this scrub, in which gaudy-leaved crotons were not
uncommon,<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> was the jungle, fairly open, but without any large
trees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>The land in the neighbourhood of this coast, and probably
as far as the hills inland and on the eastern side, which rise 800
feet, is of very recent formation, and consists of almost undecayed
coral <i>d&eacute;bris</i> mixed with sand and vegetable loam, a compound
scarcely sufficiently fertile to support a heavy forest at
present.</p>

<p>Pigeons and glossy starlings were common, and we obtained
specimens of a small forest hawk which had not been met with
on the more open island (<i>Astur</i>, sp. nov.): we shot also a new
chestnut myna (<i>Sturnia</i>, sp. nov.), somewhat similar to that met
with on Kar Nicobar. Grackles (<i>Eulabes intermedia</i>), of which
only one specimen on Nankauri had yet been seen, were fairly
numerous, and the presence of a drongo, the first of its kind
observed since leaving the Andamans, was recorded.</p>

<p>Numbers of Blyth's dove (<i>Macropygia rufipennis</i>) frequented
the scrub near the village. We were astonished to find the
crops of all those shot completely filled with large red chillies
only. It is almost impossible to conceive anything more pungent
than a red pepper, and the bird must have an extraordinary
interior to patronise such a diet exclusively. This unusual food
had no effect on the flesh, for its flavour in no way differed
from more rationally feeding members of the same species.</p>

<p>Now and again we would have visitors on the schooner, for
in the evening people often came on board to watch us as
we sat preparing specimens, and although on these occasions
we generally obtained information from the natives concerning
the locality and their customs, they were, as a rule, more
bent on satisfying their own curiosity than our desire for
knowledge.</p>

<p>One man showed us a ring, about 1&frac12; inches in diameter, of
a bone-like substance, and related a story about it of some large
jungle-dwelling animal, from whose eye, or eye-socket, it was
made. "This animal," he said, "was bigger than a pig, and
very scarce"; further than that he was not intelligent enough
to give a description!</p>

<p>Another native, "Yassan" by name, brought a letter originally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
belonging to his father, and written by de R&ouml;epstorff, who is
now almost forgotten. Yassan was more intelligent than his
companions, and we made arrangements with him to obtain for
us a collection of charms and curiosities.</p>

<p>He was a man of some standing locally, was thrice-wedded,
kept each of his "better-halves" in a separate house, and was
at the time blessed with three children, all the offspring of one
proud mother. Our conversation was carried on in Malay;
but on one occasion, when we were at fault as to his meaning,
he was asked to explain himself in Hindustani. He smiled
rather wickedly, and immediately surpassed a Kling in volubility.
Thereafter we stuck to the easier language, and guessed what
we did not understand. These natives undoubtedly include some
wonderful linguists among their number.</p>

<p>Once or twice the <i>chinchews</i><a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> of the junks brought for
treatment Chinese suffering from malaria; the crews, they said,
always contracted fever when visiting the Nicobars, and even
if they do not suffer from it on the spot, it invariably occurs
before reaching Penang. These particular vessels had been
only a month at Great Nicobar, and a fortnight at this place,
obtaining copra and rattan, but already several members of
the crews were incapacitated from hard work.</p>

<p>Those junks trading at the Nicobars&mdash;where they remain
during the greater portion of the north-east monsoon&mdash;that
come immediately from Singapore, but originally from China,
make the voyage and return between the last-named two places
in the other (south-west) monsoon, which is the bad weather
season in these waters, but the contrary in the China Sea.</p>

<p>The houses in the village were very similar in appearance
to those we had just left, but were roofed with attaps of
pandanus leaf. The process of thatching cannot be an enjoyable
occupation, for either edge of the pandanus leaf is armed
with a row of thorns, while the lower side of the mid-rib is
provided with a third row set in the reverse direction; thus
in brushing against a clump of young pandanus one is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
only pricked when approaching, but scratched while getting
away.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Behind the village we found a fairly recent grave, around
which the possessions of the deceased had been deposited&mdash;a
wooden chest with the lid wrenched off, clothing, spoons, forks,
tools, axes, <i>d&aacute;os</i>, and other things, forming a miscellaneous
collection that was rapidly rotting away. There they would
stay until destroyed by the exposure, for no one would venture
to help himself, however valuable or useful the articles might be.</p>

<p>In front of one house was a solitary example of <i>kanaia</i>,
set up on land, however, instead of in the water: possibly the
south-west monsoon blows too strongly on this coast for their
general erection. The name of this village is Ol-kolo-kw&aacute;k.</p>

<p>To reach land on the southern side of the bay we had to
cross a broad reef of coral and coral sand, thickly overgrown
with grass and corallines, and dotted with various species of
<i>holothurians</i>. The forest on shore came right down to the
water; and once inside it, we found ourselves in very truth in
the home of the megapode.</p>

<p>No sooner were we under the trees than we immediately
saw the birds&mdash;for the jungle is very open&mdash;running about,
singly or in parties of twos or threes. From all round came
their cries, perhaps best described as loud, ringing calls ending
in a rapid cackle, to the sound of which the following syllables
bear some resemblance&mdash;"&#363;rr-rak, &#363;rr-rak, ur-r-rak, rak, rak, rak,
rak!" The megapode hardly ever takes to flight when startled, but
runs quickly away among the bushes; the only occasion on
which I ever saw these birds use their wings was when once I
suddenly walked into a party of four, scratching at the foot of
a large tree. Two ran off, but the others rose clumsily in the
air, and after flying a short distance, attempted to settle on a
low branch, on which they alighted very awkwardly, and immedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>ately
lost their balance and fell off. The feet, although very
large and strong, are not adapted for grasping, and the tail
is far too short to be of any use as a balance.</p>

<p>Several birds seem to occur somewhat locally: it was on
this side of the bay only that we obtained <i>Spilornis minimus</i>,
while the little forest hawk seemed confined to the northern
shore.</p>

<p>We were unable to reach the hills in the centre of the island
from the harbour, as the swamp at its head stretches out long
arms to right and left, cutting off the land bordering the coast
from the interior.</p>

<p>Kachal is the most northerly of the Nicobars in which monkeys
are present, and, taking into account the scarcity of other
mammalian fauna and the absence of this genus from the
Andamans, it seems certain that they have been introduced.
Their non-occurrence in Tilanchong&mdash;an island eminently
suited to their requirements&mdash;goes to bear out this statement;
for, so far as we know, it has never been permanently inhabited,
and thus, unlike the other islands, offers no reason for monkeys
being brought there.</p>

<p>The people of Ol-kolo-kw&aacute;k told us these animals were
very numerous in the jungle round the village, but several
days passed before we met with them. On the first occasion,
we each obtained a specimen from the same herd. They turned
out to be macaques&mdash;one was a fine old male, weighing 21 lbs.,
an unusually large size&mdash;with fur so dark as to be almost
black, but greyish-white on the under parts. Having regard
to the colour, the species has since been named <i>Macacus
umbrosus</i>.</p>

<p>We saw them only once again, and then I found myself
within a few yards of an immense male who was on the ground.
My cartridge missed fire, and, immediately the click of the
falling hammer caught his ear, he bolted. This proved to be
our last chance of obtaining another example from Kachal.
That one always loses the best specimens, is proverbial: this
monkey was the biggest macaque I had ever seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>Such mishaps during one's earlier opportunities are always
most vexatious; later we found monkeys very numerous in
the other islands.</p>

<p>On 22nd February a Chinese junk passed northward, and
the same day another arrived, and anchored in the harbour;
that night there was carousal in the village and the noise of
much singing.</p>

<p>Visitors to the <i>Terrapin</i> were fairly continuous during our
stay here, and the appearance of some of them was as ludicrous
as it was striking.</p>

<p>One man, who wore a battered "billycock" on his head, had
encased his feet and legs in a pair of rubber jackboots; between
these extremities he sported a sailor's jersey, and the usual <b>T</b>
bandage.</p>

<p>But, impressive as was this man's apparel, it was quite put
out of the running by the <i>grande parure</i> of a fellow-dandy who
arrived later. A top-hat worn sideways, and draped with a
spotted cotton handkerchief where a mourning band might
be, a gunner's jacket, thickly laced with yellow braid, and a
light-blue pair of Chinese breeches, combined harmoniously (!)
with heavy bead necklaces, and a face profusely bedaubed with
red oil-paint. This gentleman's idea of refreshment was brandy,
and to obtain it he had furnished himself with a supply of fowls,
with which he was prepared to purchase it at the rate of a
chicken a drink.</p>

<p>When not arrayed in these exotic costumes, everyone wore
merely the <i>neng</i>, and perhaps a fillet of twisted cotton about
the head.</p>

<p>A man who came to be doctored was treated with a glass
of Eno, and an aloes pill, which he slowly sucked! This latter
is the sort of medicine natives like, and as the awful bitterness
of the drug became evident to his palate, the fellow doubtless
thought it very effective treatment indeed. Give a native 10
grains of quinine in sugar-coated tabloids, and he probably holds
you a very poor sort of doctor; but dissolve that same quinine
in a large glass of water, and make him drink the solution slowly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>&mdash;he
will perchance recover on the spot! Faith and imagination,
both in savagedom and civilisation, have a lot to do with these
matters.</p>

<p>The women of the village were very shy and timid, but we
now and again saw one or two going about their daily business;
the children, however, could not get used to us, and fled
screaming whenever we appeared.</p>

<p>A few days before we arrived at the village a woman had
died there, and during our stay a performance for ridding the
place of the ghost was gone through.</p>

<p>A large catamaran was constructed and rigged like a schooner,
with sails made of green coco-palm leaves. The local doctor or
<i>bobo</i><a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> then went through certain ceremonies, at which we were
not present, and finally seized the ghost or devil and threw it
into the boat, which was pushed off, and drifting away, was
carried out to sea, where it disappeared.</p>

<p>The Malays have an almost similar custom to this, in the
employment of the <i>kapal hantu</i> (ghost ship). This they use
during times of pestilence, or in cases of individual sickness;
but instead of forcing the evil spirits into it, they are attracted
by a show of coloured rice, etc. Once they are cajoled on board,
the vessel is pushed off, and carries the illness to whatever fresh
locality it may reach.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The day before we left, Yassan, who had promised to collect,
brought in a number of charms&mdash;figures of crocodiles, birds,
women, men, and some fever pictures, called here <i>d&eacute;&#363;shi</i> (derived
from the Portuguese for God, and is applied to the representations
of the Deity in the pictures on boards and spathes). The
people had but few scruples with regard to parting with such
things. After being paid, he asked for a <i>chit</i> and a bottle of
rum, "to use, mixed with eggs, as a medicine for his stomach!"</p>

<p>In the waters of the bay we caught quantities of small fish,
which, although easily obtained by us with the seine, cannot be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
a staple of diet in the case of the natives, who have no nets. I
once observed a native in a canoe following a shoal, and making
casts with a many-pronged fish-spear; he continually threw
his weapon, but during the ten minutes I watched him, he
caught nothing at all.</p>

<p>There is no good water here, and to fill our tanks we dug
holes just above high-water mark; the liquid that filtered in
was slightly brackish, and gave a heavy deposit of earthy matter.</p>

<p>Any quantity of coconuts may be obtained, with a few chickens
and perhaps a pig or two.</p>

<p>Kachal is about 62 square miles in area, and reaches a height
of 835 feet on the eastern side, which is composed of hills of
calcareous sandstone and marbly slate, formed in deep seas
during the Tertiary period. The western side, which is of very
recent formation, consists of a flat shore plain of coralline
alluvium, mixed with decayed vegetable matter and loam brought
down from the hill. It is covered with dense forest throughout.
The population is stated to be 281&mdash;an increase of 100 in the
last fifteen years.</p>

and Swallows&mdash;Nests&mdash;A Jungle Path&mdash;Mench&aacute;l
Island&mdash;Collections&mdash;Monkeys&mdash;Crabs.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Sailing</span> across the Sombrero Channel, some 30 miles wide,
between Kachal and Little Nicobar, we passed the islet of
Mero&euml;. It is low-lying, and about 1 mile in length. A yellow
beach separates the dark crown of jungle and coconuts from
the sea, except at the southern end, which is slightly elevated
and rocky.</p>

<p>On its western side, a tide-rip&mdash;to which the chart ascribes
a strength of 5 knots an hour at times&mdash;caught us, and we were
in some danger of being carried inshore, but that the breeze
was just strong enough to bear the schooner safely past. The
tides in the channel set strongly, and are said to attain in parts
a velocity of as much as 5 knots at springs.</p>

<p>South of Mero&euml; are the islets of Trak and Treis, and from
the deck the red sandstone cliffs of the latter could be seen
with much distinctness. Little Nicobar, rising 1400 feet,
showed broken and hilly, completely covered with dense jungle,
and beyond it Great Nicobar loomed faintly above the
horizon.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, when in the vicinity of Mero&euml;, we
were somewhat excited by a glimpse at what was perchance a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
specimen of the killer whale (<i>Orca gladiator</i>). The first hint
we obtained of the presence of such an animal, was conveyed
by the sight of a long black fin showing above the water
immediately in the course of the schooner.</p>

<p>As we sailed over the spot where it had been, we perceived,
while looking over the side, a stout, rotund body of a deep
black colour, marked with large patches of a yellowish hue
about the head and the posterior portion of the back. Only
a momentary glance was obtained before it faded from sight
in deep water, but we judged it to be some 15 feet in length.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin distinctly differed in shape from that figured
in descriptions of the killer; instead of being more or less
triangular, it was sabre-like, long, narrow, and curved.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>We were all day journeying from Kachal to Little Nicobar,
and had to anchor for the night somewhere west of Pulo Milo.
As it became dark, immense flocks of pigeons left the forests
of Little Nicobar for Trak and Treis, where they roosted for
the night, and when day dawned we saw them passing back
again. That morning, however, we made sail again, and reached
our anchorage in a very short time.</p>

<p>The harbour is a fairly good one, and is formed by the
coast of the island here bending to form a right angle, and by
the island of Milo, which forms a protection on the west. Good
shelter is afforded during the south-west monsoon&mdash;the most
important consideration; and at other times only strong northerly
winds need be feared.</p>

<p>We found 7 fathoms sand in the centre of the channel
where we rounded to; and soon after the sails were down, three
wild-looking fellows in black Chinese jackets came alongside,
followed presently by a couple of old men clothed in red cotton.</p>

<p>For some unexplained reason, they seemed much afraid,
and were with difficulty induced to believe that our intentions
were nothing but good. From answers to questions, we learned
that the people of Little Nicobar have nearly all died&mdash;a piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of information that one seems to obtain everywhere but in
Kar Nicobar and Chaura. The name of the island they
gave as Pulo Panjang (<i>Malay</i>=Long Island); it is called "Ong"
in their own language; among themselves the Nicobarese do
not employ the names familiar to us.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Little Nicobar, the second largest island of the Archipelago,
has an area of 58 square miles. It is broken up into hilly
ranges, the highest summits being Mount Deoban, 1428 feet,
near the centre of the island, and Empress Peak, 1420 feet, at
the north-east corner.</p>

<p>The bed rock is a calcareous sandstone, easily disintegrated,
and overlaid by a deep soil capable of sustaining a rich and
varied vegetation. The hills are thickly wooded from base to
summit, and there are no grassy spaces like those found on
the northern islands.</p>

<p>The nature of the forest varies according to position and
soil. In the beach forest, <i>Pandanus larum</i> and <i>P. odoratissimus</i>,
<i>Hibiscus tiliaceus</i>, <i>Barringtonia speciosa</i>, <i>Terminalia catappa</i>,
and <i>Calophyllum inophyllum</i>, are extremely plentiful; in the
littoral forest of the level inlets, <i>Mimusops littoralis</i>, <i>Calophyllum
spectabile</i> (canoe wood), and <i>Eugenias</i>, are the best represented
species; while palms (<i>Ptychoraphis augusta</i> and <i>Areca catechu</i>)
and cane-brakes are common in the moister parts. The high
forest of the hills contains fine specimens of <i>Terminalia procera</i>,
<i>C. spectabile</i>, <i>Myristica irya</i>, <i>Artocarpus lakoocha</i>, and <i>Garcinia
speciosa</i>. No Dipterocarpus trees occur.</p>

<p>The population of Little Nicobar and Pulo Milo is 67: in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
fact, with the exception of Kondul, the inhabitants are fewer
than those of any other island of the group. Its people
speak, with some variations, the dialect of Nankauri: only for
certain objects, and these, singular to say, of first necessity&mdash;coconuts,
palms, pandanus, etc.&mdash;do they employ different expressions.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
The same language is spoken by the people of
Great Nicobar. According to Hamilton, they all partook,
two hundred years ago, of the unpolished nature of their
mountainous islands, and were more uncivil and surly than
those of the northward!</p>

<p>Should the group again receive a European settlement, I
know of no spot more suited to the purpose than this: in
accommodation for shipping only is it excelled by the splendid
harbour at Nankauri; in all else it is far superior&mdash;in the formation
and greater area of ground, in fertility of soil, and in the
presence of water.</p>

<p>We landed first on Little Nicobar near some ruined huts
which once formed the village of Makachia&#7749;, deserted since 1898,
when the few remaining people either died or removed elsewhere;
and after passing through a belt of coco palms, found
ourselves in the jungle.</p>

<p>Much of the surface was level; but here and there little
chains of sandstone hills, rising two or three hundred feet,
wound about. The trees were of immense height, and in many
places beneath them one moved about as freely as in an English
forest.</p>

<p>Although this open vegetation is much more pleasant to
traverse, it is not half so satisfactory for collecting purposes
as the denser jungle, for it contains far less, both in variety
and numbers, of birds and animals.</p>

<p>Megapodes, singly, in pairs, or in little flocks, ran about
and sought busily for food, calling to each other meanwhile,
until, alarmed by the sight of such unwonted intruders as white
men, they scurried swiftly away. Overhead, so high as to be
almost out of shot, pigeons, grackles, and parrots fluttered and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
cried, while, running up and down the branches, we saw, for
the first time, the Nicobar tupai or tree-shrew, a little insectivorous
animal, which, at a casual glance, might be taken for a
squirrel. They were very common; but, unlike their representatives
in the Malay Peninsula, etc., which are ground animals,
we saw them only in the trees.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>It was soon evident that we had no cause to regret not
having obtained more monkeys at Kachal, for here they
abounded; and after discovering how common they were we
would cold-bloodedly arrange every morning as to who should
murder the specimen for the day.</p>

<p>Here a new bird was added to the islands' fauna (and to
science) in the shape of a little <i>Rhinomyias</i>, quietly clothed in
dull-brown plumage, which frequented the undergrowth of dense
jungle and possessed a rather sweet note.</p>

<p>A momentary glance of a pitta gave for a few days (until
we obtained a series of specimens) a fresh zest to collecting;
this bird also was hitherto unrecorded from the locality, and
proved to be a new species, although closely resembling <i>P.
cucullata</i>.</p>

<p>A short distance from the shore, some immense banian trees
grew so high that the pigeons and parrots which swarmed in
their branches for the fruit were often completely beyond
reach of the gun. The trees possessed, moreover, some wonderful
a&euml;real roots (70 feet high), and, standing on the edge of an
open space within the jungle, offered an opportunity for photography
too good to be passed by. While the plate was being
exposed&mdash;an operation of some minutes&mdash;a diminutive pig,
bearing a striking resemblance to the Andaman species, trotted
out from the surrounding foliage and leisurely inspected the
camera. It was the first of the kind we had seen, and I had
to reproach myself with leaving my gun at the boat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Pulo Milo is only about half a square mile in area, but is
thickly covered with a growth of pandanus and coconut trees
and jungle, above which hundreds of tall slim palms have forced
their heads.</p>

<p>The little village of four houses lies on its eastern shore,
fronted by a coral-reef that offers but little impediment to a
landing-party: one tall pole, with bunches of palm leaf, stood on
the beach&mdash;the last we met with.</p>

<p>The houses were all of quadrangular form, but with a
peculiar feature about the roofs; for the slope from apex to
eaves, instead of being straight, was in some markedly rounded,
and in others the curve ran unbrokenly across the top from
edge to edge. They were thatched with the leaves of the
nipah palm, and the side walls, 2 to 4 feet in height, were built
of rough-hewn planks laid horizontally, or of slabs of bamboo
split and flattened out. The doors were closed by <i>chicks</i> of
palm leaf, which in the daytime were propped out to shade the
interior from the sun.</p>

<p>The natives soon overcame their distrust of us, and one
evening "Shongshire," the headman, and others from the village,
came on board. The former was a stately old gentleman, in
spite of his top-hat, and somewhat resembled our old acquaintance,
"Friend of England." With him was another old man
of a most vivacious temperament, who gave us information in
a very graphic manner as we all sprawled, chatting, on the
cabin roof.</p>

<p>"There were only about a dozen people in the harbour," he
said, "although in his boyhood many lived there; all however,
were now dead from sickness and the 'orang bubu.' The former,
he believed, was caused by eating turtle, and a kind of large
fish that appeared near the shore at that period. The latter
(apparently) were evil spirits that eat men, and are let loose by
a wizard."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Although the belief in evil spirits is quite as strong as in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the central group, there is a great falling-off both in the elaboration
and in the abundance of the instruments employed in
exorcising them. In none of the houses was there either a
large figure or a picture, or more than one or two of those
minor charms which are met with in such abundance at Nankauri,
while outside the dwellings the only representative of the signs
and warnings to demon trespassers to "Keep off the grass," so
numerous in that place, was a rudely-carved post daubed with
paint.</p>

<p>The dead here, once buried, are left to rest in peace, and
the somewhat loathsome process of digging up and cleaning
the bones is not gone through.</p>

<p>It is probable that all this is a case of desuetude rather
than the original absence of custom, and that such decay of
ceremonial is due to the little value of public opinion, which is
of no weight now that the population is so small. Taking into
account that such religious accessories as they do possess, and
that similar articles in Great Nicobar, together with the architectural
type, etc., occur also at Nankauri, it is to be inferred
that there was a time when these people in no way differed in
observances from the inhabitants of that locality, who still retain
in full the paraphernalia by which they outwardly mark the
practice and maintenance of their superstitions.</p>

<p>Concerning the Shom Pe&#7749;, we heard that though resembling
the Nicobarese in appearance, they use a different language.</p>

<p>They are fairly numerous, and those living near the shore
are on friendly terms with the coast people, bartering jungle
produce and rattans. It is not wise, however, to go into the
interior of Great Nicobar, as the wild men (orang utan) will
murder strangers for the sake of their clothes and ornaments.
They themselves are clothed in bark apparel. Their houses are
either light shelters, the materials of which they carry about in
their journeys, fitted with bunks one above the other, beneath the
lowest of which a small fire smoulders; or are of a more substantial
construction, with a fence<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> surrounding each house cluster.</p>

<span class="caption">HOUSES, PULO MILO.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>In shape, Pulo Panjang is roughly a parallelogram, but its
north-west side is somewhat eaten away; and the bay thus
formed makes, together with Pulo Milo, a most effective
harbour.</p>

<p>At the apex of this is a small secondary bay, where a little
river, rising in the hills inland, debouches through a broad belt
of mangroves. The salt-water basin, although partially choked
with coral, would, in the event of settlement, serve well as a
small boat harbour.</p>

<p>We ascended the stream several times in search of the big
storkbilled kingfisher (<i>Pelargopsis leucocephala</i>), which, strangely,
occurs again in Borneo, and at no spot between that island and
the Nicobars; the case of the megapode is exactly parallel.</p>

<p>The river at first ran through a forest of young, but lofty,
mangroves (<i>Bruguiera gymnorhiza</i>), whose straight stems, leaning
towards each other across the stream, bore a certain resemblance
to an assemblage of scaffold-poles. At length, when the land
became less swampy, they gave place to a fringe of nipah or
attap palms, the fruit of which looks like an exaggerated pine
cone, and is sometimes eaten by Malays, while from the tender
inner shoot, the same people obtain a wrapper for their
cigarettes.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Finally, where the banks became dry and solid, they were
overgrown by luxuriant jungle&mdash;a mixture of forest trees, bamboos,
palms and rattans, with here and there bordering the stream,
a many-footed, white-skinned pandanus, and often a beautiful
tree fern (<i>Alsophila albasetecea</i>), that immediately brought to
my mind the blue hills and equally lovely valleys of New
Zealand.</p>

<p>The stream, although maintaining a depth of 5 to 10 feet,
at length became very narrow, and we were compelled, in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
to proceed, to chop away the network of vegetation that overhung
the water. Now and again it ran through open spaces
covered with tall and matted grass, and then between banks a
dozen feet high; but when we were forced to stop, unable to proceed
further, the water was still brackish, although we had almost
reached the hills in which it takes its source. The banks were
frequented by herons, redshanks and other waders, and kingfishers
(both <i>P. leucocephala</i>, with sandy head and body and
blue wings, and the tiny <i>bengalensis</i>, the counterpart of our
English bird). Several beautiful butterflies were seen, a rather
common species, with velvety black wings, blotched with turquoise,
constantly flitting up and down the course of the stream.</p>

<p>We obtained good water in the harbour; slightly to the
west of the little bay, a rocky hill makes an angle with a little
beach of bright sand, and at the point of junction a path leads
to the spring a few yards inland, where, in the jungle, the
trickling water runs down a face of black rock, and collects in
a stony basin. By forming a slight dam at the foot of the
rock, any quantity can be collected.</p>

<p>In the rocky hill just mentioned, we discovered several caves,
which run inwards from mouths situated at the water's level.
These are the homes of thousands of tiny leaf-nosed bats
(<i>Hipposideros nicobarul&aelig;</i>, sp. nov.), and immense numbers of the
bird's-nest swift (<i>Collocalia linchii</i>).</p>

<p>The largest of these caves is about 50 feet deep, and 20 feet
high at the entrance; but at the back the accumulation of guano
is so great that there is barely room to stand. As we entered
with a lantern, our feet sinking ankle-deep into the soft chocolate-coloured
floor, there was a continual rush of little bats and birds
overhead as they sought to escape, and with a leafy branch we
knocked over a number of each kind before going to the end.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;">
<img src="images/fp126.jpg" width="584" height="412" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">JUNGLE VEGETATION, LITTLE NICOBAR.</span>
</div>

<p>The rock at the back was covered with countless numbers of
the shallow cup-shaped nests of saliva-gummed moss: so closely
were they built, that in many cases one could not place a fingertip
on the rock between them, and often they were constructed
one on the side of the other. Nearly every one contained two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
comparatively large, white eggs, or ugly, unfledged nestlings.
Fortunately for the birds, they are builders of the green variety
of nest; for had these been white, they would not long have
remained undisturbed by the Chinese.</p>

<p>Swifts and bats&mdash;the one as graceful as the other is hideous&mdash;would
seem queer neighbours, although there is a certain affinity
between the two, for both enjoy the same food&mdash;flies and other
insects&mdash;and obtain it on the wing without mutual interference; for
the first hunt by day, and the others are nocturnal. In the cave,
the swallows breed at the inner end, while the bats congregate
near the mouth.</p>

<p>Another small cave was inhabited by bats only, and so thickly
were they suspended from the walls, that one could kill a dozen at
one blow. For long after we left the spot, clouds of swifts whirled
about the entrance; but the bats, when disturbed, immediately
disappeared in the jungle above.</p>

<p>The only path on Little Nicobar runs across its northern
peninsula. It starts near a couple of dilapidated huts opposite
Pulo Milo, and, running first through a belt of tangled scrub,
crosses the little range of hills near the western coast, and then,
traversing a stretch of rich flat soil, covered with splendid open
forest, and great numbers of the Nicobar palm (<i>P. augusta</i>),
finally comes out on the east coast opposite the small island
of Mench&aacute;l, which lies a mile or so distant, and is only
half a square mile in area. It is covered with forest, containing
many coco palms and tree ferns, and also clumps of two
species of giant bamboo (<i>Bambusa brandisii</i> and <i>Gigantochloa
macrostachya</i>). It is of sandstone formation, covered with deep
soil or sharply-worn coral. Somewhat farther down the coast is
a small village, and the path has been made to connect this with
Pulo Milo.</p>

<p>The forest through which the path ran was our favourite
collecting ground. We met there for the first time the beautiful
little sunbird <i>Aethopyga nicobarica</i>, with crown and tail dark
shining blue, throat and breast scarlet, through which ran two
moustachial streaks of brilliant blue, the remaining plumage olive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
grey, but further ornamented by patches of bright yellow beneath
the wing and on the back. This is the male, for the hen bird,
as in all sunbirds, is of very inconspicuous plumage. This
species is very local in distribution, and does not occur in the
northern islands.</p>

<p><i>Astur soloensis</i>, the forest hawk, was not uncommon, but took
pains to obtain, for it was very wary. Before beginning to call,
one had to hide in a bush, or behind a tree trunk, and the chances
were that when the bird did arrive it would perch behind you, and
then, since its swooping flight is perfectly noiseless, one remained
in ignorance of its proximity. Then, too, it might rest five yards
away or fifty: in the former case, if you were not prepared with
a suitable cartridge, the bird was lost, for there would be no time
to reload; in the latter event, it was better to knock it over
straightway than run risks in bringing it closer. Once they
become frightened, or see what is making the call, they are off,
not to return, "charm you never so wisely."</p>

<p>A parrot&mdash;<i>Pal&aelig;ornis caniceps</i>&mdash;restricted entirely to the two
southern islands of the Nicobars, was very common about here,
where its screams and chattering often broke the prevailing silence
of the jungle. For such a bird, it was clad in sober colours; for,
saving a grey head, across the front of which&mdash;like a pair of
spectacles&mdash;there ran a patch of black feathers, the plumage
was of green only. The whole scheme was somewhat relieved
in the male by an upper mandible of scarlet.</p>

<p>Monkeys abounded, and on some days we might see as
many as fifty or a hundred. They are so numerous that in
both Little and Great Nicobar the coco palms, except in the
neighbourhood of villages, are altogether unproductive, and
this, according to the natives, is because the monkeys screw
off every nut the moment it begins to form.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>They, too, are very timid in some ways, but one is able to
get at them through their intense curiosity. The attempt to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
stalk a herd of these animals is often a futile proceeding; but
if, when you have seen them, you keep quite still, and attract
their attention by some unusual noise, such as a continued
tapping on your gun-barrel, you will generally have them all
round you in a very short time.</p>

<p>The effect, on the monkey, of man's appearance, is most
interesting. The expression of their emotions is certainly
almost human, as they sit and stare at him, coughing and
snarling with anger and contempt, drawing back their heads
and throwing the hand before the face with a gesture of abhorrence,
and other movements indicative of shocked and outraged
feelings. But predominant is the expression of absolute
horror, which, coming from those we consider our still degraded
cousins, is to our superiority very aggravating.</p>

<p>A troop of monkeys travelling through the forest and
feeding as they move, is also worth watching. Their presence
is plainly indicated, even when some distance off, by the crashing
noise made as they leap from tree to tree. Having reached
the extremity of one branch, the monkey, with a swing and a
flying leap, conveys himself to another, not alighting as a rule
on a bough of any size, but generally coming down on all
fours amongst the small twigs, a bunch of which is immediately
embraced.</p>

<p>In their manner of feeding they show a perpetual craving
for change, the most fruitful tree not detaining them for many
moments; while for each fruit from which a single bite is
taken, half a dozen are plucked and thrown down.</p>

<p>Crabs swarmed nearly everywhere: scarlet hermits, that
dragged about their variously-shaped domiciles in which they
shut themselves up and lay inert when disturbed; and the
hideous, purplish land-crabs, that scrambled away waving
threatening claws at sight of a stranger. So numerous and
rapacious were all these, that a week's assiduous trapping for
mammals only produced one specimen, since the baits were
always immediately discovered and devoured by the unwelcome
and valueless crustacean.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>Before we left, a number of men from Great Nicobar
arrived in a large canoe: they were proceeding to Nankauri
on one of the expeditions undertaken by the Nicobarese when
they desire to obtain the pottery manufactured only by the
women of Chaura.</p>

<p>We weighed anchor at sunrise on March 4th, having added
a pitta, an owl, and the <i>Rhinomyias</i>&mdash;all new species&mdash;to the
avifauna of the islands during a most satisfactory visit of seven
days.</p>

Rowing.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">On</span> the same day, we anchored as night fell, close to the island
of Kondul, having sailed down the west side of Little Nicobar&mdash;a
coast of sand-beaches and steep jungle-covered hills&mdash;and
crossed the St George's Channel, which divides the latter island
from Great Nicobar.</p>

<p>Kondul is 2 miles in length, and half a mile wide, and, while
running N.N.E. and S.S.W., lies too far from the larger island
to form a harbour, although sheltered water is nearly always
to be found on its lee-side.</p>

<p>We dropped anchor in 7 fathoms, opposite a little beach and
some coconut palms on the western shore, and next morning
rowed to the village on the other side, meeting on the way a
strong tide-rip, off the south-east point, that for long kept us
from making any progress.</p>

<p>The island is about 400 feet high, and its grey cliffs of slate
and sandstone rise steep and bare until they meet the dense
jungle with which the upper part is covered. Only on the
east is there any flat land, and there, on a stretch of coral
soil, are situated the houses and gardens of the natives, who
now number some 38 individuals.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>We landed behind a projection of the reef which afforded
shelter from the swell, and were met by the headman "Dang,"
who brought with him the shipping register.</p>

<p>Some of the buildings were round, others rectangular in
shape, and supported by leaning-posts in addition to the piles;
and here and there were erected a few slightly carved and
painted stumps, draped with bunches of palm leaves.</p>

<p>The headman's house contained small figures of a man,
woman, and child, and some painted nuts, also a large mirror
in a gilt frame&mdash;a useless object probably obtained from the
Chinese in return for some thousands of coconuts. We learned
that there were many Shom Pe&#7749; on the neighbouring coast,
but that they were very nomadic, and badly disposed towards
strangers.</p>

<p>Our talk over, we left the house and rambled about, behind
the village, in a plantation of coco palms, bananas, and limes
growing in rich alluvial soil; and then, proceeding along the
shore, crossed a little stream, and making a d&eacute;tour round a
mass of broken rocks, reached a further village of three houses.
Here the people were rather nervous at first, especially when
asked to stand for their photographs, and needed much
reassuring before we got on satisfactory terms; but <i>Jangan takot,
kita orang baik</i> (Don't be afraid, we are good men), and similar
expressions, before long brought about more friendly relations.</p>

<p>After purchasing a supply of coconuts, limes, and as many
chickens as could be obtained, we returned to the schooner and
sailed for the north coast of Great Nicobar, known to the natives
as "Sambelong," or "Lo-&ouml;ng."</p>

<p>With the wind ahead, it was once more evening before we
reached the little bay where we had decided to stop. Anchoring,
at first temporarily, at the mouth, in 5 fathoms, the dinghy went
off to sound, and ascertain whether we might enter. The bottom
was sand and coral, and shoaled rapidly, until at the mouth we
found a sandbar that almost dried at low tide. Of a village which
we expected to see, since it was marked on the chart, there was no
trace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 419px;">
<img src="images/fp132.jpg" width="419" height="604" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">MAN WITH PANDANUS FRUIT, KONDUL.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morning following our arrival, we set to work, on the
right shore of the bay, to cut a path up the steep hills which rise
immediately from the water. This caused so much noise, however,
that nearly every animal and bird was scared from the
neighbourhood; and since we could only proceed along the
summit of the hills, where such specimens as were shot were in
danger of rolling down the steep sides and being lost, after setting
a number of traps, we returned to the boat and set out to explore
the bay.</p>

<p>The little basin at its head was surrounded by steep hills, but
on the right a stream flowed through a gap in the latter. Beyond
this the land sank, and opened out into a seemingly interminable
mangrove swamp, through which the river wound deviously.</p>

<p>From the mangroves overhanging the stream we obtained
several nests of a sunbird (<i>Arachnechthra</i>, sp. nov.). These in
shape were something like an old-fashioned net purse, covered
with lichen, and were suspended from the ends of branches. The
entrance was in the side, and in each we found two pale-brown
eggs mottled with a darker pigment.</p>

<p>Half-an-hour's row brought us to the end of navigation, and
at that point we met with a vast colony of fruit-bats (<i>Pteropus
nicobaricus</i>), occupying the mangroves on either side of the river.</p>

<p>At a small computation, several thousand animals must
have been hanging head downwards from the branches, and the
surrounding atmosphere was impregnated with the musty odour
of their bodies. When we disturbed them, they gave vent to a
continuous "skirling" noise, somewhat like the song of cicadas,
but less shrill in tone.</p>

<p>By nature they are very fearless, and the majority merely
stared inquisitively; a few spread their great wings and flapped
heavily away for a short distance, and others crawled actively
along the branches back downwards.</p>

<p>All the females carried, clinging to the breast, a young one of
about one-third full growth; these the mothers hugged to themselves
with a folded wing, but when unsupported, the young found
no difficulty in maintaining its position, by means of its excessively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
sharp claws and its suction grip on the parent's teat. When the
latter crawled about, the baby was supported in the membrane
of the wing, which bagged slightly with the weight. I should
imagine that it is not thoroughly weaned until the birth of a
fresh offspring.</p>

<p>The action of these bats when climbing a vertical branch, is
similar to a man's in shinning up a pole. The wings are first raised
and a tight grip taken with the claw on the thumb, then the feet
are drawn up, and, after they obtain a hold, the wings are once
more lifted. When taking to flight, they swing to and fro once
or twice, and then let go in a backward direction.</p>

<p>Several were obtained for specimens, and amongst them were
two old females, which were shot without damage to the accompanying
young. These latter I afterwards attempted to rear. At
first they made no effort to escape, but clung tightly to the
mother's teat. When they arrived on board, I put them into a
box, fitted with a perch, from which they could suspend themselves,
but I found they had barely strength to sustain their
position by means of the hind feet only.</p>

<p>For food I gave them bananas mashed into a pulp, and a weak
solution of condensed milk. The former, after masticating and
extracting the juice, they would eject, but the milk was readily
lapped up, or sucked from my finger tip.</p>

<p>The two did not agree well, but remained during the day in
opposite corners of the box. At night they were very restless
and noisy, continually uttering shrill cries, and often fighting.
When I had owned them a few days, they escaped one night
from their rough cage, and at daybreak were found high in the
rigging. Later they escaped again and disappeared; reaching,
I believe, the adjacent shore.</p>

<p>After exploring the neighbourhood, we found a good patch
of flat jungle on the east shore of the bay, and near the sandbar
across the mouth discovered a faint path leading inward.
Following this across some damp ground, we saw numerous
tracks of men and dogs, which certainly pointed to the presence
of Shom Pe&#7749;, as the Nicobarese said they themselves never went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
inland; but although we searched the locality thoroughly, we
failed to obtain more pronounced signs of occupation.</p>

<p>The forest abounded in life. Nearly every morning&mdash;generally
the first bird obtained, and only seen thus early&mdash;a beautiful pitta
was shot. Nicobar pigeons, sometimes in large flocks, every now
and then rose with loud flight from the ground, where they were
busy searching for food; for, unlike the big grey fruit-pigeons,
with green-bronze back and wings (<i>Carpophaga insularis</i>), these
birds are ground-feeders. The little brown <i>Rhinomyias</i> was
very plentiful, as was the tiny kingfisher, <i>Ceyx tridactyla</i>, a most
gorgeous bird, with coral-red feet and bill, and plumage of
brilliant yellow, orange, blue, and lilac.</p>

<p>In a deep rocky ravine (that in the wet season must be filled
with running water), arched over with tall jungle trees, and
containing beautiful tree ferns, whose waving heads rose above
the edge, I shot our first full-plumaged specimen of the Nicobar
fly-catcher. Though not of brilliant colouration&mdash;for the slightly-crested
head is of steely blue-black hue, and the remaining
plumage of a silky-white (saving the large feathers of the wings,
which are delicately pencilled with black, and the quills and
edges of the tail feathers, the two central being several inches
long, which are marked with the same colour), with blue bill
and feet&mdash;this bird is to me perhaps the most beautiful of all the
Nicobar avifauna; and while there are many of far more gorgeous
plumage, none can approach it in delicacy, and the quiet beauty
of its colouring.</p>

<p>Tracks of pig were very numerous in the low ground, and
we often met with herds of monkeys making their way through
the jungle; no rats, however, were trapped in this place, although
crabs were scarcer than usual.</p>

<p>Water we obtained on the east side of the basin, just within
the sandbar, but we had some difficulty in discovering it. The
skipper, while engaged in the search, reported having found a
number of spiked stakes planted in the jungle, similar to the
<i>ranjows</i> of the Dyaks.</p>

<p>An old man, named Barawang, arrived one day in a canoe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
He spoke English fairly, and said he was headman for the
west coast, producing a Port Register in support of his statement.
He formerly lived at Pulo P&eacute;t, but fled thence with his family
to Kondul to escape a raiding party of Shom Pe&#7749;.</p>

<p>The waters of the bay swarmed with shoals of little fish,
which were much preyed upon by the <i>ikan parang</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> a long,
thin, sabre-shaped fish with a formidable set of teeth; it is often
seen darting along above the surface of the water, which it
just flicks with its tail. Of the small fry we caught immense
quantities with a casting-net, and obtained larger varieties with
the seine, by fixing it on stakes across the mouth of the creek
at high water; by the time the tide had fallen, several fish had
invariably become entangled in the meshes.</p>

<p>On the 10th we made sail, and proceeded a little further
along the coast to Ganges Harbour, anchoring just within its
eastern point. If the chart is correct, changes have taken place
on the coast since the last survey. We lay opposite a small
stretch of flat land, and where the plan gives the coast-line
nearly straight, a little bay now exists, where stand stumps
of dead trees, about which the low tides expose a broad expanse
of black mud.</p>

<p>After wading through the mud to reach the shore, we found
that much of the low-lying ground was merely swamp. Part
however, was covered with tall, open jungle, in which were
numbers of pigeon and parrots. There were no monkeys, but
tupais (<i>Tupaia nicobarica</i>) were plentiful. These appear to be
entirely arboreal in habits, and are quite as active as squirrels
in running along branches, or climbing about amongst smaller
twigs in search of insects. Their cry is a sort of trilling squeak,
which is easily confounded with the call of a bird.</p>

<p>In crossing to the further side we found plentiful traces of
Shom Pe&#7749;&mdash;a faint path, a ruined hut, heaps of shells, and
split seed-cases of the <i>Barringtonia speciosa</i>. The edge of the
land was rapidly being eroded, and many tall casuarina trees,
with roots undermined by the water, lying prostrate in the sea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
At either end, this disappearing beach was hemmed in by rising
ground and rocks, which at its eastern termination contained a
little stream and basin of good water.</p>

<p>On the 12th we rowed about the shores of the harbour,
landing every now and then to search for the aborigines. The
only signs of man's presence discovered, however, were rows
of stakes set up across the creeks in the mangroves. One of
these rows we utilised to hang our own net on, and obtained
there such an abundant catch of small fish that we returned the
greater part to the sea.</p>

<p>The shore-line is much more indented than the outline given
on the chart, and in the shallow water and mud of a little bay,
rows of tree trunks still stood, two or three hundred yards from
the land. This subsidence, however, is local in its occurrence,
for everywhere else in the Archipelago signs of elevation are
markedly present, and it is to be attributed to seismic agency&mdash;earthquakes
having several times been experienced in the group&mdash;and
not to a general depression of the land.</p>

<p>The following day we went still farther afield, and crossed
the harbour to a beach where stood a grove of coconut trees
and a small hut. The trees were without fruit, and the house,
though deserted, contained a number of bundles of split rattan,
such as a small section of the Shom Pe&#7749; trade in with the
coast people. The plantation was surrounded by hilly country,
covered with tall, open jungle: birds were scarce, and a hawk
and a megapode were all we obtained in the way of feathered
booty; but, immediately on landing, Abbott caught sight of a
couple of pigs, and knocked over the boar with a bullet. Though
very similar to the Andamanese pig in size and appearance, it
had patches of white on the feet. From it a new species has
been described, under the name of <i>Sus nicobaricus</i>.</p>

<p>While rowing back to the <i>Terrapin</i>, we were overtaken by a
blinding squall of wind and rain, which half-filled the boat and
made the men (who sat with their feet on the thwarts) very uneasy,
lest they should be polluted by contact with the blood and
water that swished about in the bottom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day we extended our search still farther, and ascended
a little river, to which the name of "Jubilee" has been given by
the surveyors. We rowed up several arms of this stream
that wound to and fro in the mangroves, but only found a small
fishing weir constructed of rattans. The muddy shores swarmed
with water-birds&mdash;herons, whimbrel, redshanks, and others&mdash;and
we surprised a monstrous crocodile, little less than 20 feet long,
who rushed into the stream long before our guns were ready.
Returning to the mouth, we landed and walked for a couple of
miles along the beach; but the shore was everywhere covered
with dense tangled scrub, behind which lay the swamps of the
river.</p>

<p>On the last day of our stay, a junk arrived from Dring,
where it had taken in a cargo of coconuts. It was handled
very clumsily, and nearly ran on the reef before the anchor was
down, eventually having to make sail again and beat up to a
more suitable place. Considering the happy-go-lucky manner
in which these junks are navigated, it must be admitted that
they have good fortune&mdash;they have a compass, indeed, but all
those we met were totally unprovided with charts.</p>

<p>Our mornings in this place were spent in searching for Shom
Pe&#7749;; the afternoons were passed in adding to the collections. The
traps produced a couple of rats only; but we obtained several specimens
of the storkbilled kingfisher, which was common about the
shores of the bay. Several turtle were observed on the sea, but
the harpoon never being at hand when requisite, they always
escaped unmolested.</p>

<p>Possibly because of the proximity of high land&mdash;for Mount
Thuillier, 2100 feet, the highest point of the Nicobars, rises near
the northern end of the island&mdash;a good deal of rain fell every day,
and somewhat spoiled the enjoyment of wandering in the jungle.
At night when we lay in Ganges Harbour, it was nearly always
calm, and many mosquitoes came from shore to plague us.</p>

<span class="caption">BOYS OF KONDUL.</span>
</div>

<p>Traps were set on the shore throughout our stay, and we thus
obtained a specimen of a new shrew (<i>Crocidura nicobarica</i>), the
largest known Oriental member of the sub-genus; while two rats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>&mdash;all
that were caught&mdash;were both undescribed varieties, and have
been named <i>Mus pulliventer</i>, and <i>Mus burrescens</i>.</p>

<p>Having filled up with water&mdash;obtained from a little stream
trickling down a cool rocky ravine at the inner corner of the bay&mdash;we
made sail early on the 16th, and returned to Kondul.</p>

<p>Two hours' run before the wind brought the schooner to our
former anchorage, where we were immediately joined by a junk
from the north, and shortly afterwards by our companion of
Ganges Harbour. After breakfast we reached the village, subsequent
to a hard pull in the whaleboat against wind and tide, and
found the junks' crews busily loading their boats with bundles of
rattan; and by a chat with one of the skippers, supplemented the
scanty information of the <i>Sailing Directory</i> anent the west coast
of Great Nicobar.</p>

<p>Very few people were about, and the headman, suffering from
an attack of inflammation of the eyes, had wisely confined himself
to the shade of his house. Four jolly little boys, however, bestirred
themselves to get us a supply of coconuts. One, after putting a
loop of fibre round his ankles, climbed a palm tree and hacked off
all the fruit, and then we all set to and carried the plunder down
to the boat&mdash;a very awkward task, unless one knows the correct
method, for the coconut is both heavy and bulky. With a <i>d&aacute;o</i> a
notch is made in the husk and a strip of fibre pulled out, with
which the nuts are tied together two by two, and slung across a
pole, to be comfortably balanced on the shoulders. To the owner
of the tree we gave a bucket of rice, and to our juvenile assistants
a length of bright cotton, which one, a bald-headed youngster,
immediately annexed and wrapped round his shaven pate.</p>

<p>Towards evening they came to the schooner with an old man,
bringing some more nuts and a few fowls; they joined the crew
at the evening meal, but were very nervous, and one boy, whom
the men wickedly pressed to stay, eventually took refuge in his
canoe.</p>

<p>That night quite a small fleet&mdash;the two junks and ourselves&mdash;lay
in the quiet anchorage. The cook and boy, smartly attired in
black oiled calico, went off in the dinghy to visit their compatriots.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
The style of their garments must be held to excuse the absence
of that quality in their rowing, for each man's stroke was a thing
to itself, as he painstakingly illustrated the famous maxim of Mr
Charles Bouncer, "Dig your oar in deep, and pull it out with a
jerk!" Perseverance and a devious course brought them to their
goal; but we retired to sleep with dubious opinions as to their safe
return.</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 17, 1901.&mdash;At 6.30 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> both junks left, and we followed
half an hour later. The breeze was light, the sea smooth, and
the Chinese kept ahead all the way: in fact, we only caught up
the smaller just abreast of Pulo<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> Kunyi, our destination on
the west coast, where we anchored shortly after the big junk
about midday; the other boat did not stop, but sailed on for
another village more to the south.</p>

<p>"Great Nicobar is the southernmost and the largest of the
islands of the group, having a length of 30 miles north and
south, and a breadth of from 7 to 14 miles, while the area is 334
square miles. The highest part of the island is that to the
north, where Mount Thuillier attains an altitude of 2105 feet.
A continuous range of hills runs down the east side of the
island close to the coast, making the surface hilly; and near
the centre a range 1333 feet high extends crossways in an
E.N.E. direction.  On the west side the hills are much more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
irregular in disposition, and there are broad alluvial plains
between their bases and the sea.</p>

<p>"Both in vegetation and geological formation it resembles
Little Nicobar, but is the only island of the group that possesses
navigable rivers; for, when their bars are passable, the Dagmar
and Alexandra rivers on the west, and the Galathea River in
the south, can be ascended some distance towards the interior.</p>

<p>"The coastal population is barely two-thirds what it was
computed at in 1886, and now numbers 87 only. In the
interior are the Shom Pe&#7749;, who, liberally estimated, may number
from 300 to 400; but, as a few friendly families alone are all with
whom communication has been held, it is impossible to arrive
at any definite conclusion.</p>

<p>"Great Nicobar is the least known of all the islands; the
Government steamer seldom visits it, on account of its few
inhabitants, the rough weather frequently met with on its coasts,
and the absence of harbours near the populated districts.</p>

<p>"As we sailed along the north-west portion, we perceived it
to be low and flat for some distance inland, but towards the
south the land rose in irregular forest-clad hills.</p>

<p>"The village of Pulo Kunyi lies along the shore of a small
bay, from either end of which two long reefs of coral stretch
out seaward to form the harbour. This is further protected by
a submerged coral bank which lies across the mouth, leaving
only two narrow passages to north and south, of which the
former is the more practicable.</p>

<p>"With a man in the cross-trees and a lead from the junk, we
got in safely&mdash;finding 6 fathoms in the middle of the entrance&mdash;and
brought up in 3&frac12; fathoms, in a well-sheltered anchorage where
there was plenty of room for several small vessels to lie.</p>

<p>"As soon as all was shipshape on board, we went ashore
with our guns. In the village, which consists of five buildings
(sheds and houses), we met but two men&mdash;women and children
had disappeared from fear of the Chinese and ourselves; but
there are probably not more than ten inhabitants altogether.</p>

<span class="caption">MAN AND WOMAN OF THE SHOM PE&#7748;, AND A NICOBARESE.</span>
</div>

<p>"The Chinese were already at work, busily appropriating all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the coconuts that lay about. When purchasing these, they
give a bag of rice for 530 nuts, which sell at Singapore for $15.
Barter worth $1 is given for half a dozen bundles of rattan,
which fetch about $12 in the same market. The trade of this
island is mostly in canes, for very few more coconuts are produced
than suffice for the wants of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>"The one beehive hut in the village was occupied by an old
man named Awang, with his wife and child. A large charm
hung in the centre of the house&mdash;a frame about 8 feet by 6 feet,
covered with palm leaves, across the top a row of birds, and
at the foot a line of wooden men, each supplied with a ration
of fat pork.</p>

<p>"Our persistent inquiries about the Shom Pe&#7749; seemed to amuse
Awang excessively; but we were delighted to find we had arrived
in their neighbourhood at last. The aborigines live a short
distance in the interior, and often come down to the coast; as
they would do on the morrow, when we should have an opportunity
of meeting them, since notice had been sent that the
traders were waiting to purchase their stock of rattan.</p>

<p>"The inland tribe is split into two main divisions. The larger
inhabits the interior proper, and is still hostile (there was a man
in the village with some ugly open wounds beneath the shoulderblades,
who had been speared by them close to the houses a year
ago); the members of the other division, who form small settlements
near the coast villages, are known as "mawas Shom Pe&#7749;"
(quiet, or tame Shom Pe&#7749;), and are on intimate terms with the
Nicobarese, fearing equally with them the wilder natives. When
the latter are out on the warpath, the friendlies come down to the
shore, and, with the coast people, leave the district by canoe until
it is safe to return.</p>

<p>"The village is surrounded by open scrub and jungle, in which
large numbers of screw-pines flourish. The little scarlet-breasted
<i>Aethopyga</i> was common here, and numbers of them were flitting
about the crowns of the coco palms, searching the fruit-stalks and
bases of the leaves for insects.</p>

<p>"Good paths ran through the jungle, and following one to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
southward, we reached the shore of Casuarina Bay, so named from
the long grove of dark-foliaged trees that extends right along the
coast. All round the head of the bay white surf rolled on the flat
sandy beach, but there was a fair landing-place within the point,
protected by a reef, and free from breakers.</p>

<p>"Before returning to the village we shot a number of tupais,
some sunbirds, and a serpent-eagle. The local dogs all wore a
large coconut slung loosely about the neck. This heavy burdening
would hardly meet with the approval of the S.P.C.A.; but it
prevents the dogs from chasing sows and their litters, and is a
most effective hobble, as it hangs right between the fore-legs.</p>

<p>"Darkness was approaching as we passed through the village,
and the fowls were all retiring to rest in the branches of the trees&mdash;a
return to early habits that they may indulge in with security
in these islands, where no mammal more dangerous than the
monkey exists.</p>

<p>"The boat soon came off to fetch us in answer to a hail, and
we returned to the schooner, where, after a bath and a dinner,
we settled down to an evening's work."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 575px;">
<img src="images/fp144.jpg" width="575" height="412" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">A VILLAGE OF THE SHOM PE&#7748;.</span>
</div>

<p>"<i>March</i> 18.&mdash;Armed respectively with guns and camera, we
struck inland, at sunrise, along a path running eastward through
beautiful open forest. The ground was level, and our way lay for
some time within sound of the breakers of Casuarina Bay. Picking
up a bird now and again as we went along, we had proceeded
some three or four miles when we heard the sound of voices in the
bush. We stopped for a moment to listen, and then moved on.
Presently the roof of a hut appeared between the trees. "Shom
Pe&#7749;!" we whispered, and, creeping down the path with the idea
of getting among them before they could run, did they feel inclined,
walked&mdash;oh, miserable swindle!&mdash;into a camp of Nicobarese
rattan-gatherers; for the numerous bundles of canes hanging from
the trees, and the heaps of scrapings, showed plainly what their
occupation was.</p>

<p>"In a clearing about 30 yards across, surrounded by jungle, and
standing in the shade of a few isolated trees, five huts stood along
the bank of a little brook.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Women and girls in waistcloths, busy preparing food from
pandanus fruit, dropped their work when they caught sight of us,
and rushed away for more clothes!</p>

<p>"Pigs, chickens, and dogs wandered about beneath the houses,
and the only representative of the stronger sex was a young man,
whose activity was much handicapped by a leg swollen with
elephantiasis.</p>

<p>"The houses were small structures built on piles, 4 to 6 feet
high, with open sides, and roofs of attaps.</p>

<p>"After taking photographs of the village, we returned to the
shore, where consolation awaited us in the persons of three Shom
Pe&#7749; men, who had come in and were detained in Awang's house.
Thither we proceeded, and took photographs and measurements
of each. They were very docile, and stood like statues before the
camera; neither did they object to being measured. We obtained
from them a roll of coarse cloth&mdash;made from the inner bark of
a tree,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> which is stripped from the trunk and pounded&mdash;and a
rattan basket, giving in return an extra quantity of red cotton, in
token of goodwill, for they had been inclined to bolt when they
first heard we were coming.</p>

<p>"In general appearance these men resembled the Nicobarese,
but were of slightly darker complexion&mdash;muddy-coloured&mdash;and
physically of more slender build, and leaner: they wore cotton
<i>kiss&aacute;ts</i>, and large wooden ear-distenders.</p>

<p>"Through Awang, who enacted the part of interpreter, we
arranged with them to come down the next morning, and bring
their whole party, baskets, spears, and more cloth."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 19.&mdash;We did not shoot for long this morning, for fear
of frightening the Shom Pe&#7749;; but though we waited about till
10 o'clock, they had not appeared, and we then returned to
the <i>Terrapin</i>.</p>

<p>"But for flies, which were rather numerous about the village,
it was very pleasant lying in the shade of the palms, lazily
watching the many butterflies which floated about, listening
to the cries of oriole, calornis, and sunbird, and often catching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
glimpses of their brilliant plumage as they flew from tree to
tree. In the clear waters of a little stream that flowed behind
the village, we could see shoals of fish slowly drifting about, or
poising themselves in the shade of the overhanging branches.
The mouth of this stream is closed by the coral-reef, but a
few small canoes are kept on its surface to carry the natives
to the other bank. We were too lazy even to explore its course,
but loafed drowsily beneath the coco palms, while</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="noidt">
"All round the coast the languid air did swoon,<br />
Breathing like one that hath a weary dream,"<br />
</p></div>

<p class="noidt">until, stirred by prosaic thoughts of breakfast, we returned to
the schooner. Hardly had we done so when we caught sight
of a string of people walking along the beach, whereupon,
gathering together the necessary paraphernalia for an interview,
we jumped into a boat and were soon on shore again.</p>

<p>"The party consisted of five men, three women, and three
girls&mdash;there were no boys or babies in it. They had brought
with them several rolls of new bark cloth&mdash;pieces about 4 feet
by 6 feet&mdash;which, when fresh, is much lighter in colour than the
old piece we got before; some rattan baskets of various shapes,
ear-distenders, and a bundle of spears made of the hard wood
of the nibong palm. These spears are about 8 feet long, and
half an inch in diameter, tapering towards the butt. The
makers have grasped the principle of the sail and surgeon's
needle, for the points are triangular, with sharp edges; immediately
below them, slight barbs, generally six in number, are
carved on the shaft.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>"In physique, the men were less robust than the coast people,
but at the same time were tough and wiry-looking&mdash;the lesser
chest and arm development being probably accounted for by
the absence of paddling exercise, for they own no canoes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 389px;">
<img src="images/fp146.jpg" width="389" height="602" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">WOMEN AND GIRLS OF THE SHOM PE&#7748;.</span>
</div>

<p>"In person they were somewhat dirty, more markedly in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
case of the women, to whose clothes the odour of stale pandanus-bread
clung strongly. All chewed quids of betel, lime, and
sireh leaves.</p>

<p>"The teeth of one woman presented a most extraordinary
appearance, that at first sight appeared to be a case of macrodontism;
the upper row projected outwards at an extreme
angle, and, when closely examined, proved to be concreted
together by a substance that was apparently a deposit of lime
from the ever-renewed quid.</p>

<p>"Their hair, like that of the Nicobarese, varied from wavy to
curly, and so slightly did they differ from the coast people that
if one did not know who they were, they would pass, unless carefully
examined, for ordinary Nicobarese, so far as appearance
and mode of life are concerned.</p>

<p>"In proof of this statement it will suffice if I say that the
settlement which&mdash;with minds primed by tales of bark-garments
and triple-storied, fenced-in huts&mdash;we had thought to be a camp
of the coast people gathering rattan, was, in truth, the village
of this identical party.</p>

<p>"Such a mistake was, under the circumstances, almost justifiable&mdash;their
food, utensils for its preparation, cooking-pots,
clothing, and domestic animals, were all exactly similar to those
of the Nicobarese.</p>

<p>"It would appear, that, from constant intercourse with the
shore people, the Shom Pe&#7749; have adopted many of their
customs, and become possessed of similar property. The leader
of this party even spoke a few words of Malay.</p>

<p>"All of them willingly submitted to be photographed and
measured, especially when they saw that after the process
there was a reward of red cotton, or brass cartridge cases, to
be used as ear-plugs. Such things as they received in this
way, or in payment for baskets and other articles, were immediately
handed over to the women.</p>

<p>"They seemed to indicate time by pointing to the sun, and
by such a method we made them understand that we should
pay another visit to their camp on the morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 20.&mdash;We reached the Shom Pe&#7749; village early in the
morning, and found its occupants variously engaged&mdash;some sitting
listlessly about, and others busied in splitting and cleaning the
rattan which they trade with the coast people.</p>

<p>"The community was well supplied with food, in the shape
of coconuts, bananas, and various tubers, besides possessing a
plentiful store of pandanus fruit. Several young pigs, all
obtained from the litters of wild sows, which are chased with
a view to capture, were domiciled in cages within the houses.</p>

<span class="caption">Shom Pe&#7749; Cooking-vessel (Great Nicobar).</span>
</div>

<p>"Principal amongst the articles in use were iron-pronged
fish-spears, axes, and <i>d&aacute;os</i>, with baskets, of which we purchased
a selection; but the most interesting object visible, and one
that had been overlooked during our former visit, was an
apparatus for preparing the food of pandanus paste.</p>

<span class="caption">MEN OF THE SHOM PE&#7748;.</span>
</div>

<p>"Some 6 inches above a clay hearth on the floor of the
huts, a receptacle, about 3 feet by 3 feet by 6 inches, was formed
of five sheets of thin green bark. These, two on a side, and
the fifth doubled at the bottom to form a trough, were inserted
at either end between split stakes, which&mdash;bound tightly together
with rattans&mdash;pressed the edges of the sheets against each other.
The lower part was thickly luted with clay, and where the
edges of the bark overlapped, a strip of cane was stretched from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
stake to stake to compress the join. This ingenious vessel was
narrow at the bottom but gaped widely at the mouth.</p>

<p>"In cooking the pandanus, a little water is first poured in,
and the fruit piled above it and steamed; when sufficiently
done, the bread is prepared by the same method as practised
on the coast.</p>

<p>"Several paths led beyond the camp; and following one, we
crossed a small stream by a tree bridge (a couple of saplings
laid side by side), 300 or 400 yards beyond which we arrived
at the bank of the Dagmar River, here a stream about 40 yards
wide flowing between low jungle-covered banks.</p>

<p>"Once more by the sea we photographed Awang and his
family, bought some of his belongings, and also took possession
of about twenty megapodes' eggs which he had collected for us.</p>

<p>"The Shom Pe&#7749; we had seen, he informed us, were all there
were in the neighbourhood, although far back in the interior
were other, but unfriendly, groups. The only child in the
village was his own son, and the same old story was repeated&mdash;that
where formerly there were two or three men with their
families in each house, now there was only one.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon we walked along the shore of Casuarina
Bay to the mouth of the Dagmar. Fortunately the tide was
low, and exposed a broad strip of hard wet sand, which made
the tramp very pleasant, in spite of the hot sun. On the way,
we passed the half-dry bed of a small stream, crammed with
thousands of a little black red-bellied mud-fish, so crowded
together that numbers had died.</p>

<p>"The Dagmar River emerges suddenly from jungle, with
banks almost free from mangrove and nipah, and makes its way
to the sea through a curving channel in the sand, where at low
tide it is very shallow.</p>

<p>"Bundles of rattan hung from several trees, and a small hut
full of the same material stood near a path that evidently led
to the Shom Pe&#7749; village. More cane was to be seen across the
river, and a canoe lay on the bank.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 383px;">

<span class="caption">MEN OF THE SHOM PE&#7748; (in profile.)</span>
</div>

<p>"So much we discovered by a little exploring; then, after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
climbing a palm and refreshing ourselves with stolen coconuts,
we set out on the return walk, in order to avoid being overtaken
by darkness."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 21.&mdash;A light breeze set in shortly after 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and
we weighed anchor. It soon freshened somewhat, and we
worked down the coast, tacking on and off. First we passed
the point forming the north extremity of Casuarina Bay,
distinguished by a single palm tree which rises high above the
jungle, and next came abreast of K&oacute;penh&eacute;at, marked by a grove
of palms and a hut, finally bringing up at 1.15 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> in 9 fathoms,
at a spot well protected by a reef from the S.W. swell, with a
conspicuous round house bearing E. This anchorage was a
little bay formed by the shore running roughly N. and W., and
we were in an indentation of the reef, which, when the latter
dries at low tide, is about 300 yards wide.</p>

<p>"The village here is called Pulo Nyur (<i>Malay</i> = Coconut
Island), seven houses in all, and lies in the shade of palm trees
broken into groups by intervening stretches of jungle.</p>

<p>"Going ashore in the afternoon we met in the largest house
several men and boys from Pulo B&aacute;bi, the next village southward.
Of the other buildings, four or five are uninhabited and falling to
pieces. There was only one regular inhabitant in the place&mdash;a
man whose father, brother, and wife had all died six months
previously, and who, unless he could get another wife shortly,
intended to leave the spot, which will probably soon be deserted,
for his female acquaintances&mdash;not unnaturally&mdash;objected to such
a lonely life.</p>

<p>"A year ago a man was killed by the Shom Pe&#7749; on the
outskirts of the village, and at the same time the man we saw
at Pulo Kunyi barely escaped with his life.</p>

<p>"Several paths lead towards the interior, but the village has
no (friendly) relations with the aborigines.</p>

<p>"Behind, and to one side, lay a large stretch of grass-covered
swamp, on which a herd of monkeys was playing until we
appeared, while numbers of herons, big and little, were perched
in the surrounding trees. The morass was composed of a sort of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
sawdust-like paste, into which one sank up to the knees, yet the
feet, when withdrawn, were not in the least soiled. In the jungle
we got Nicobar pigeons, and a serpent-eagle that seemed to differ
from the variety of Little Nicobar and Kachal (<i>Spilornis</i>, sp.
nov.).</p>

<p>"A path from the beach led to a water-hole, which only
required clearing out to afford a plentiful supply; the men set
to work at this, and when they had got rid of the water, took
from the hole a pailful of mudfish and eels.</p>

<p>"Learning in the evening, from people who came on board,
that there were Shom Pe&#7749; on the Alexandra River and at
K&oacute;penh&eacute;at, we determined on an expedition in search of them
next day."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 22.&mdash;At sunrise we put off in the whaleboat, and
now rowing and now sailing, as the wind served, and all
the time keeping well out from shore, to clear the rollers that
occurred at irregular intervals in most unexpected places, reached
Casuarina Bay (about 6 miles) at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span></p>

<p>"The breakers at the mouth of the Dagmar were too big for
us to enter the river without an almost certain wetting, to avoid
which we pulled back to the south end of the bay, and first
wading ashore with the contents, ran the boat through the
surf and quickly beached her. Almost at once we perceived
within the jungle a deserted Shom Pe&#7749; village of three huts,
of a kind similar to those beyond Pulo Kunyi. In the camp
were two or three platforms or lounges, roughly shaded by a few
palm leaves, and some odds and ends were lying about; a small
pig cage, food baskets made from the butt of a palm leaf, and a
rude lamp&mdash;a shell, in which lay a bit of greasy rag supported
on half a coconut.</p>

<p>"Several paths converged at the village, and these we followed
up until each gradually came to an end&mdash;bundles and strips of
rattan lying along them, showing plainly their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.</p>

<p>"One path, however, led past a second camp. Some of the
huts were merely rough platforms built against the trunk of a
tree; but others were evidently of the kind we had been told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
about at Pulo Milo&mdash;one platform above the other, respectively
3 and 7 feet above the ground, both partially protected by a
number of long palm leaves leaning butt downwards against the
structure. Continuing onward beyond this village we reached
the Dagmar River, and searched along the bank for further paths
without success.</p>

<p>"By midday, having thoroughly explored the locality, we
returned to a tiffin of biscuits and sardines, with unlimited
numbers of young coconuts, which one of the men quickly
obtained from an adjacent tree. Then the boat was launched
and loaded, and with the wind helping for part of the distance
we travelled back to the <i>Terrapin</i>.</p>

<p>"As we passed K&oacute;penh&eacute;at two men put out in a canoe with
palm-leaf sails to inform us that a party of Shom Pe&#7749; was
then at their house. But it was now getting late, and the
plates for the camera had all been exposed, so, after arranging
for the aborigines to remain until next day, we parted from the
canoe and proceeded to the schooner."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 22.&mdash;Off again by boat in the morning to K&oacute;penh&eacute;at
and met the Shom Pe&#7749;, who had remained overnight; they
having come a distance variously estimated at from half a day
to two days' journey (!) down the Alexandra River in small
canoes of Nicobarese construction.</p>

<p>"The headman, who was of the darkest complexion yet met
with&mdash;a dull chocolate&mdash;spoke a little Malay. All were clothed&mdash;in
far more garments than the Nicobarese&mdash;and generally very
dirty.</p>

<p>"Most of these people were afflicted with elephantiasis in
various stages&mdash;none seriously, however. Nicobar water is reported
to be bad; but, considering the state of the water-holes that the
Shom Pe&#7749; paths lead to, no surprise can be felt that those who
use such a supply should be suffering from this disease. Often
the water of the coast natives is unsatisfactory enough in
quality, but having plenty of coconuts, they hardly ever use it
for drinking purposes.</p>

<span class="caption">HUT OF THE SHOM PE&#7748;.</span>
</div>

<p>"After we had finished with the people we gave them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
presents of cotton and sheath-knives, and then followed a path
leading to the Dagmar through forest of a very open character.
A walk of half a mile brought us to the bank of the river,
here about 30 to 35 yards wide. There was very little current,
owing to a sandbar across the mouth, which the natives say
is dry at half-tide. The banks were jungle covered, and free
from mangroves.</p>

<p>"Before leaving the village we bought some fowls, and a pair
of young monkeys, said to be only three or four months old.
They were imprisoned in a pig cage, and seemed half-starved,
and were certainly very frightened as they sat clinging convulsively
to each other.</p>

<p>"There is clear water, 300 or 400 yards wide, before K&oacute;penh&eacute;at,
with a reef on either side where the sea breaks heavily
at high tide, but the anchorage is not so good as at Kunyi
or Nyur."</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">We</span> hove up anchor at 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>&mdash;the hour at which a breeze
usually sprang up&mdash;and sailed for Pulo B&aacute;bi, a few miles down
the coast, taking as passenger an old man named Domeat who
had been staying at K&oacute;penh&eacute;at.</p>

<p>He produced a number of <i>chits</i> for our perusal, and from one
we learned that it was Domeat&mdash;now a toothless, but sturdy old
gentleman, with nutcracker jaws and a benevolent expression&mdash;who
brought news of the recovery of the body of Captain Elton,
commander of the station gunboat, who was drowned in the
surf while attempting to land at Trinkat Sambelong<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> village, on
the east coast, in March 1881.</p>

<p>Most of the letters were written by Asiatics, and from them
it seemed that the last Malay vessel to call at the islands arrived
in 1877. Many formerly came to purchase coconuts, but this
people, like our own nation, has been ousted from the trade by
the inhabitants of China and the Indian Empire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 672px;">
<img src="images/fp154.jpg" width="672" height="413" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">CANOE AT PULO NYUR, GREAT NICOBAR.</span>
</div>

<p>According to our informant, the Chinese pay the coast natives
one packet of tobacco (value 2&frac12;d.) for three bundles of rattan,
while the Nicobarese, who act merely as middlemen, and have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the export trade in their hands, only give the Shom Pe&#7749; one
packet for six bundles! The bush aborigines have no settled
dwelling-places, but wander about, although they have good
gardens established in various localities. Their language is
quite distinct from the Nicobarese,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> but each knows enough of
the others' speech to make themselves mutually understood.
Asked, however, whether further south we could get a man
who knew the Shom Pe&#7749; language, Domeat replied: "When
one of us sees a Shom Pe&#7749; he runs away, and when a Shom
Pe&#7749; sees a Nicobar man he spears him!"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>Misunderstandings frequently occurred when we talked to
him about the various places on the coast. The name given on
the chart is often not known to the natives: the Chinese have
another name, which is not given on the chart, and the natives
have a third, but are generally familiar with that used by the
traders.</p>

<p>We arrived off the village at 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, and worked in to an
anchorage against a land breeze. The junks in whose company
we had been at Kondul were already in the harbour&mdash;a square
indentation, fringed with coral. With a look-out at the masthead
we got in without accident, and anchored in a fairly sheltered
position, but some distance outside the other vessels. Small
streams debouch in either corner of the bay; but the village,
which consists of a dozen or more houses, and is the largest on
the west coast, lies to the south of the harbour, with the usual
accompaniment of numerous coco palms.</p>

<p>As a heavy surf was breaking on the reef fronting the houses,
we rowed up the bay and landed by a small hut, beside which
was a well of good water, and from thence reached the village
by a path leading through scrub and many screw-pines.</p>

<p>Interviewing the headman, we learnt that a Shom Pe&#7749; settlement
lay half a day's journey in the interior, and having arranged
with Nyam (the headman) to guide us on the morrow, we set
out, accompanied by his brother Puchree, on a stroll through
the village.</p>

<p>This really consists of two settlements&mdash;that nearest the bay,
Pulo Rotan or Ko&eacute;, and the other to the south, which at high
tide is cut off from the mainland by a marshy channel&mdash;Pulo
B&aacute;bi or Kanal. There are more houses, both round and square
than appear from seawards, but several are uninhabited and
falling to pieces. Graves, placed between the houses, were marked
by peeled sticks and young saplings, on which a foot or so of
the branches had been left.</p>

<p>The land on which the village stood was of very recent
formation, consisting entirely of sand, coral blocks, and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of the roughest kind.</p>

<p>It would seem that the Nicobars are not only an area of
elevation (as shown in Kar Nicobar, Trinkat, etc.), but also one
of growth, as appears to be the case in the islands where there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
is a central mountain mass with radiating arms and shore
plains; in these the central high land was first elevated, and
formed a core for the extension of land by the agency of
fringing reefs where the surrounding sea-bottom has only a
slight inclination.</p>

<p>Of this latter phenomenon Pulo B&aacute;bi appears to be an
example, since, for some distance inland the shore is flat, and
composed of coral sand and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, with a substratum of fresh-looking
coral rock. The bay is becoming choked with coral,
and between living reef and shore are broad belts of slimy
mud, a little lower than some of the coral heads beyond, where
the reef, having reached low-water level, has stopped in its
growth and died. Meanwhile it is extending outward on its
own talus, and at the same time <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and sand are cast
continually shoreward, and, with the help of smaller coralline
growths, fill up the interstices of the shore coral until a solid
bank is formed, which, by further aid from the waves of the sea,
and from the land and its vegetation, is raised above high water
and in time becomes dry land.</p>

<p>Such action depends on the tides, slope of the sea-bottom,
and the relation of one part of the shore to another in regard
to contour and position, but particularly on the currents, which in
some places would accumulate material and in others remove it.</p>

<p>The crowns of the palm trees were frequented by flocks of
the black and white nutmeg-pigeon (<i>Carpophaga bicolor</i>), an
uncommon bird in such a situation. Of those we shot, several
lodged in the trees and were fetched down by the natives, who
climbed with the ankles joined by a belt or piece of rattan, and
who, when lifting the feet, did not clasp the trunk with the arms
as we should, but placing one round it, pressed against it with
the other hand.</p>

<p>We found two Shom Pe&#7749; youths in the village, who seemed
to be in a state of easy servitude, and were used for such work
as carrying nuts or fetching water.</p>

<p>There were between twenty and thirty men and boys
dwelling here, and the skipper (with whom the people were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
more communicative than with us) said, only four women!
Although, by going to Naukauri Harbour, said Puchree, they
could obtain wives,&mdash;who, however, refused to leave their own
homes,&mdash;he lamented the almost total impotence of himself and
neighbours in the way of offspring. Asked if they ever married
Shom Pe&#7749; women, he said, "No, they didn't like them; they were
dirty and didn't wash"; and when we suggested that he should
catch (<i>tangkap</i>) a young one, and first train her for a year or
two, and teach her manners&mdash;"Too much trouble."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 25.&mdash;We met Nyam and a companion at his house
about six o'clock, and after a walk of half a mile reached the
bank of a little river some 30 feet wide. Here lay a canoe, and
paddles being produced we travelled up-stream, wading now
and again over the shallows, until, having progressed a mile or
so, we landed on the same bank at a spot where a second path
commenced. This we followed for 2 miles in a northerly
direction, crossing by the way the stream itself and a little
tributary by bridges of sapling, and so arrived at the Shom
Pe&#7749; village.</p>

<p>"We had already seen two kinds of buildings amongst these
people; here we met with a third.</p>

<p>"The houses&mdash;five in number, and recently constructed&mdash;stood
on piles about 12 feet high; in several cases a live tree being
built in. These supports were strengthened by diagonal struts&mdash;a
most uncommon form of scaffolding among savages. The
floors were made of saplings placed side by side, and the side
walls, about 3 feet high, of split nibong palm; while the
roofs, which just afforded head-room at the apex, were roughly
thatched with whole palm leaves, piled on butt downwards.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 410px;">
<img src="images/fp158.jpg" width="410" height="578" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">HUTS OF THE SHOM PE&#7748;.</span>
</div>

<p>"Each house was about 8 feet square, and at one end of
each a small platform was attached, on which was the fireplace,
with cooking apparatus of bark sheets covered with large green
leaves, to prevent charring. In a corner of each hut was a
shelf of split sticks, and a long trough of split and hollowed
palm trunk sloped from ground to floor for the dogs and other
animals to mount by. The ladders for human use were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
about 18 inches wide, with cross-pieces fastened on by rattan
bindings.</p>

<p>"The village lay at the foot of a hill, above which the sun
appeared between nine and ten o'clock, and was bounded on
the other side by the bed of a stagnant brook. The trees
about the houses were festooned with bundles of rattan, and
the ground round them was littered deeply with the refuse
scrapings. A few chickens and a miserable pariah cur or two
wandered about, and several little pigs were caged in the huts.</p>

<p>"This party seemed less well-to-do than the others we had
seen, for their only dress was cotton <i>kiss&aacute;ts</i> and waistcloths,
and while possessing several pieces of bark cloth, in which they
wrapped themselves at night, they had apparently no further
clothing. Strings of coloured beads were worn about the
neck, and their ear-lobes were distended by wooden plugs from
1 to 2 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>"They were of a most apathetic disposition. A few words
were exchanged with our guides, whom the women immediately
supplied with lime and sireh, and then, renewing their
own quids, sat crouching in the doorways of the huts, or perhaps
attended by request to the head of a neighbour who might
be troubled with a parasitical itching. Although free from
elephantiasis, the body of each individual was covered with
the scaly symptoms of ringworm&mdash;<i>tinea circinata tropica</i>.</p>

<p>"After we had measured the whole party, there was sufficient
light to photograph the village, to which, in the dark shade of
the jungle, I gave an exposure of ten minutes. The portraits
of the natives were taken under difficulties, for the only rays
of sunlight that filtered through the branches shifted slowly
with the rays of the sun, so that by the time the subject was
posed and focussed, he was generally outside the patch of
sunshine.</p>

<p>"We bought all the little property visible, and then returned
to the schooner by path and canoe, having found that the
so-called 'half-day's' journey resolved itself into a matter of
little more than an hour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Later in the day we strolled through the coast village to
watch the progress towards completion of a partially-finished
canoe we had purchased. With a little supervision it was
only a short afternoon's work for three or four men to cut
and fit, by means of their <i>d&aacute;os</i>, the stem and stern, cross-pieces,
outriggers, and float, and quickly do all the fastening
required with tough strips of rattan.</p>

<p>"Our guides of the morning were rewarded with a <i>sarong</i>
apiece and we purchased with rupees a pair of captive nutmeg-pigeons&mdash;somewhat
uncommon pets&mdash;and a couple of grey-headed
parrots (<i>P. caniceps</i>) that had been obtained as fledglings
by the villagers.</p>

<p>"Once again on board we found canoes arriving with loads
of coconuts and numbers of fowls. Old shoes were the principal
articles demanded, but the skipper got six chickens for
a white linen coat. Our estimable captain is actuated by a
commercial spirit; his invariable greeting to a new arrival
is 'Ah, <i>hang sudah datang</i>! <i>apa hang bawa</i>?'&mdash;'Ah, you've
come! what are you bringing?'"</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 26.&mdash;Spent an hour on shore, and then left with the
breeze at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> Sailing slowly down the coast we passed
Henpoin, Pulo Kotah, and Henh&oacute;a, at all of which places are
many coco palms, with one or two houses visible. Two or
three miles inland a range of hills runs down the coast, and
must form the eastern slope of the Galathea Valley; until
their foot is reached, the country is low and level.</p>

<p>"Off South Point the wind became very light at midday, and
subsequently we worked up and down against a strong north-westerly
tide, barely maintaining our position. After a small
advance, at 10 P.M. we were back again where we had been at noon,
so, getting soundings of 9 fathoms, we anchored for the night."</p>

</div>

<p>"<i>March</i> 27.&mdash;At daybreak the current was running S.S.W., at
2 knots. This slackened at nine o'clock, and with a light breeze
from the N.E. we gradually made our way towards South Bay,
until, the wind becoming more easterly, we tacked up it, and
anchored towards the top in 7&frac12; fathoms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>"The head, where the Galathea River debouches, is low and
flat, but on either side the shores are a continuation of the
hills, containing the river. The eastern cape is hilly and broken,
but the western extremity tails off in a low stretch of flat land.</p>

<p>"Close to the western shore is Walker Island, a small grey
block of rock that has been likened to a fort with sentries&mdash;the
latter represented by columns of stone protected from detrition
by boulders of harder formation, which once, of course, rested
on the surface of the islet.</p>

<p>"Coconut trees grow all round the bay, and on the starboard
hand we saw a dozen houses forming the village of Chang-ngeh,
from which a canoe put off with two men. They, and two
others far advanced in decrepitude, are the sole inhabitants of
this portion of the island. Formerly there was on the eastern
shore a village called Bad&oacute;i, but after some of its inhabitants
had been killed by Shom Pe&#7749;, it was deserted.</p>

<p>"We got ashore near the village at a spot sheltered from surf
by a projecting reef. Close inspection showed that the houses
were far more dilapidated than they appeared to be from the sea.</p>

<p>"Having obtained megapodes, dongos, and sunbirds by a
short excursion into the jungle, we walked along the beach to
examine the river mouth, in view of a journey up-stream next
day.</p>

<p>"Coming from the right, where it runs for some distance
parallel to the shore, the river turns suddenly and makes its
way to the sea through a stretch of sand, leaving on the left
a quiet backwater into which the current swirls. A continuous
line of surf broke across the entrance, which was very narrow."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 28.&mdash;At sunrise, having made all preparations overnight,
we loaded the boat with food and bedding, mosquito nets,
and collecting apparatus, and put off for the expedition up-river.</p>

<p>"First we pulled ashore and landed some of the cargo, for
with it all on board and a crew of five, the boat was too heavy
to negotiate the breakers safely. Then we lay off the river's
mouth watching the sea; swell after swell came sliding in, until
one larger than the rest swung by, leapt up, and with the white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
foam rippling along its summit, fell over with a thunderous
crash. Pulling hard all, we swept along on its top, then passed
through the surf, and lay a few moments later on the quiet
surface of the river without having shipped a drop of water.
When the things landed had been fetched, we reloaded and
pulled up-stream; the last glimpse of the sea showing a Chinese
junk rounding the eastern extremity of the bay.</p>

<p>"At first the river was about 30 yards wide and ran between
low banks covered with stretches of mangroves and forest alternating,
both fronted by a border of nipah palms. About 2
miles onward the shores rose a little, and the vegetation changed
to a tangle of jungle, with a network of climbing bamboo, rattans,
and various kinds of creepers. The course of the stream ran
through no heavy forest, and in many places the banks were
fairly open, covered with scrub and patches of thick grassy
vegetation.</p>

<p>"Never was such a river for twisting and turning, and often
as we steered round its <b>S</b>-shaped bends we seemed to swing the
sun right round us.</p>

<p>"We rowed along steadily for a couple of hours, and then
seeing a lime tree overhanging the stream, stopped to gather a
hatful of fruit. A few yards further on&mdash;the bank about 12 feet
high&mdash;one of the men spied a rough hut, a mere platform with
a shade of palm leaves; but when we landed, although odds and
ends of rattan lay about the ground, it was evident that it had
been unoccupied for some time.</p>

<p>"Now and again along the river we saw coco palms and
bananas, while <i>kaladies</i> or yams grew plentifully at the water's
edge. The banks were covered here with jungle and there with
stretches of reeds, looking not unlike clumps of Indian corn.</p>

<p>"Flocks of parrots flew screaming overhead, herons flapped
lazily away in front, and now and then a monkey, startled by the
unusual sight, cursed us vigorously from a tree. Often a tiny
<i>ceyx</i>&mdash;a flash of lilac and orange&mdash;darted across the stream, and
oftener still the little blue <i>bengalensis</i> flitted away before us.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<span class="caption">ON THE GALATHEA RIVER, GREAT NICOBAR.</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once we ran aground on some rocks, and twice had to
scramble on fallen tree-trunks spanning the river, and force the
boat beneath them. But for such incidents we progressed steadily
upwards until eleven o'clock, when we pulled to one of the banks,
here only some 15 yards apart, and tying up the boat, proceeded
to camp during the heat of midday.</p>

<p>"Then, after breakfast had been disposed of, it was delightful
to lie on one's back in the shade of the jungle and watch the
waving leaves against the sky; to search with the eyes for graceful
ferns and orchids drooping from the branches overhead, and in a
dreamy semi-slumber to listen to the calls of the birds, and the
faint voices of the men as they rambled about in the forest.
Presently, as the sun reached its highest point, all became quiet,
and we dozed an hour away, to wake up, and&mdash;after boiling the
kettle for some tea&mdash;start off once more.</p>

<p>"Gradually narrowing, the river maintained the same character,
save that the banks became more open. At one fallen
tree we had to unload the boat and haul it bodily over; several
times we got round or under such obstacles with difficulty; and
so, rowing and poling as the stream lessened, we went on, until
at about five o'clock, the river, now only 25 feet wide, became
so shallow and obstructed by fallen branches that we were forced
to cease all attempt at further progress, and so made camp at
a spot about 16 miles up-stream, almost in the latitude of Pulo
B&aacute;bi. In the rainy season it would perhaps be possible to
ascend a few miles higher.</p>

<p>"While daylight lasted, the boat was partly unloaded, sticks
cut to support the mosquito nets, and supper prepared&mdash;heaped-up
plates of snowy rice, eked out by various tinned commodities.
Then after re-charging the dark slides beneath a
rug, and covering the baggage with a tarpaulin in case of
rain, we turned in.</p>

<p>"It was a glorious moonlight night and the cicadas sang us to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
sleep from the trees, while the mosquitoes hummed away vainly
and viciously outside the net.</p>

<p>"Now and again, for a time, came the cry of some startled
bird and the croaking of the tree-frogs; but when these died
away the prevailing silence was broken only by the sound of
the dew dripping from the trees, and the occasional fall of dead
leaves or rotten branches."</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 29.&mdash;We turned out at daybreak while the river was
shrouded in mist, and after <i>chota hazri</i>, started down-stream.</p>

<p>"The water had fallen a foot during the night, and for some
distance we could only use the oars to pole with. Presently,
however, we were paddling quickly down the river, until we came
to the fallen tree, where it was again necessary to unload.</p>

<p>"All the contents were stacked on the bank, and then, while
the boat was on the trunk, I walked along the latter to take a
snap-shot of the scene from the shore. Just as it was half-way
across, our craft stuck fast; all, gathering themselves together,
gave a mighty heave, and suddenly it slipped over, taking
everyone by surprise. 'Din fell into the water, 'Dul fell into
the boat, Mat straddled the tree, and Abbott, by a display of
flying, gibbon-like agility, succeeded in landing safely in the
stern. It was all very amusing to see from the shore; far too
funny, indeed, at the time for me to get my photograph.</p>

<p>"This was the only obstacle, for, thanks to the low tide, we
found no difficulty in passing beneath the other fallen trunks.
About ten o'clock we were back at the hut and lime-tree, and
stopped there for breakfast; then, after gathering a bucketful of
fruit, were off again.</p>

<p>"With the sun almost overhead, it now became very hot on
the water; but, pushing on, we reached the river-mouth soon after
one o'clock and unloaded the boat once more before taking it
through the breakers. From inshore they seemed much more
formidable than from seaward, whence their height and the curl
of falling water were hidden. We lay a short distance from the
long, white lines that travelled across the bay, and watched them,
backing and pulling to keep our place.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"A series of breakers fell, then in rolled a monster, and as it
broke before us, we dashed in the waiting oars and sped forward
at the next. Up went the prow, and we were over and in the
hollow before a second; then over that and yet another, and we
lay on the gently-heaving surface of the bay.</p>

<p>"Back once more beneath the schooner's awnings, we found
a welcome supply of thirst-quenching coconuts, brought freshly
from the village.</p>

<p>"The junk, after taking in a supply of water, had left the day
before. It is customary for these vessels, after their business on
the west coast is over, to sail round the north end of the island
when leaving for Acheen, in order to make a slight gain to windward;
but this one, having learned that we were going direct,
decided to take a similar course."</p>

<p>On March 30 we went ashore for the last time and found a
good supply of water at Bad&oacute;i, about 100 yards inside the
jungle. The stream dies away before reaching the sea, but above
the watering-place it can be followed for some distance by wading
up the rocky bed.</p>

<p>We were now full up with wood and water, and having
obtained a good supply of fowls and coconuts from the village,
were ready to put to sea, so left at ten o'clock in the evening,
with a light wind, and a tide running S.W.</p>

<p>"<i>March</i> 31.&mdash;At 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> the point below Mataita-&acirc;&#7749;la bore
W. about 7 miles. Squalls of wind and rain occurred, and
a succession of waterspouts travelled across the horizon; between-times
and for the rest of the day, we experienced a dead calm,
and rolled about on the swell. Position at 4.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, 8 miles east
of Campbell Bay."</p>

<p>"<i>April</i> 1.&mdash;There has been scarcely any wind, and we drifted
N. by E. until Menchal and Kabra hove in sight. A school of
sharks visited the schooner, and one about 7 feet long that
was hooked, was given his quietus with a revolver bullet when
hauled to the surface.</p>

<p>"Our live stock is flourishing. The three sober-looking
parrots down in the cabin are becoming tamer day by day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and the pair of nutmeg pigeons will already eat chopped coconut
from our hands.</p>

<p>"The monkeys, however, are of most interest, and are given
daily exercise on deck. The male is an adept at the most
horrible grimaces, but is an arrant coward, and, when startled,
rushes to his companion, and, although the heavier of the two,
puts his arms around her and is carried back downwards all
over the place. When it is time to re-cage them, we have only
to drive them together and they run into each other's arms,
clasp convulsively, and incontinently roll over, when, as they
lie squealing and grimacing on deck, they may be picked up
and put back in their box. On one occasion this man&#339;uvre was
executed on the rail, and they fell overboard, sinking without
a struggle, locked in a close embrace.</p>

<p>"Fortunately for them, the <i>Terrapin</i> was becalmed at the
time, and they were recovered, to be very subdued for a time
after the rescue, but none the worse for their experience.</p>

<p>"At 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> a light breeze sprang up, with signs of a squall
from the north, and carried us along at a 2 to 3 knot pace
through the night. A porpoise was harpooned under the bow,
but broke away before it could be secured.</p>

<p>"On the 2nd the wind was light all day, save for a squall that
compelled us to lower the foresail. Towards evening, Mount
Thuillier, bearing W. by N., was just visible 50 miles away. The
breeze freshened, and with darkness the last sign of the Nicobars
dropped below the horizon, while daybreak revealed ahead of
us the rounded summit of Pulo Bras."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3>THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS AND THEIR INHABITANTS</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">Position&mdash;Soundings&mdash;Relationship&mdash;Islands&mdash;Area&mdash;Great Andaman
Mountains&mdash;Little Andaman&mdash;-Rivers&mdash;Coral Banks&mdash;Scenery&mdash;Harbours&mdash;Timber&mdash;Flora&mdash;Climate&mdash;Cyclones&mdash;Geology&mdash;Minerals&mdash;Subsidence&mdash;Earthquakes&mdash;History&mdash;Aborigines&mdash;Convicts
and the Penal System&mdash;Growth
and Resources of the Settlement&mdash;Products and Manufactures.</p>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> Andamans, which together with the Nicobars form one
of the minor dependencies of our Indian Empire, are situated
in the Bengal Sea, between the parallels of 10&deg; 30' and 14&deg; 15'
N. latitude, and the meridians 92&deg; 10' and 93&deg; 30' E. longitude,
where they lie in a N. by E. direction. To the west the coast of
Madras is some 700 miles distant, and eastward Tenasserim,
bordered by the islands of the Mergui Archipelago, lies about
320 miles away. Intervening between them and Sumatra to
the south lies the Nicobar group, and before Cape Negrais in
Burma is reached the little island of Preparis must be
passed.</p>

<p>Close to Cape Negrais terminate the Arakan Hills, one of
a series of ranges that run down from the Eastern Himalayas;
and just south of Acheen Head we have the Gunong Mas, Batu
Mukuruh, and other mountains; therefore, looking at a map of
the district, it seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that the
whole of the islands last enumerated are nothing less than a
continuation southward of the Arakan Hills.</p>

<p>But although they form a chain that seems to indicate a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
past union of Sumatra and Burma, investigation proves that
this is far from being the case. For soundings in this part
of the ocean show that between the Nicobars and the group
of islands adjacent to the north-east point of Sumatra&mdash;entering
from the open sea to the west, and thence trending north between
the Andamans and Malay Peninsula almost as far as the latitude
of Narkondam&mdash;there runs a long tongue of depressed ocean bed
with depths everywhere over 1000 fathoms. This fact, together
with the shallowness of the sea-bottom around and connecting
the Andamans with the Arakan Yoma Peninsula, suggests
the inference that the former were at one time past the
termination of a seaward extension from Cape Negrais of the
Arakan Yoma Range&mdash;a conclusion that is in some degree
emphasized by the zoological and botanical conditions common
to the two.</p>

<p>The principal islands are, Great and Little Andaman,
Rutland and the Labyrinths, the Archipelago, North Sentinel,
Interview Island, Landfall Island, and the Cocos, but there are
many smaller adjacent, while to the eastward are the off-lying
volcanic islets of Narkondam and Barren Island. The total
area of the group is 2508 square miles.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Great Andaman&mdash;in which may be included Landfall and
Rutland Islands, for the whole land mass is so compact and
divided up by such narrow shallow straits that it appears to be
one single island that has been broken up by subsidence and
adjoining volcanic action&mdash;is 142 miles long, and 17 miles broad
at its widest point.</p>

<p>There are generally stated to be two straits, but as one of them
bifurcates, the Great Andaman proper is really cut into four parts.</p>

<p>Austin Strait, which divides North from Middle Andaman, is
very narrow and intricate, and not to be traversed by boats at
low tide; but the Andaman Strait,&mdash;generally 2 to 3 cables
wide&mdash;which separates South from Middle Andaman at a spot
where the hills are lower than elsewhere, although intricate, and
possessing a bar at its eastern mouth with a depth of 9 or 10<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
feet at low water, has depths from 10 to 14 fathoms throughout
the narrower part, and nowhere less than 3 fathoms at low water.
The stream is never strong, and the R.I.M.S. <i>Investigator</i> passed
through three times while surveying the islands in 1888.</p>

<p>Homfray Strait cuts off B&aacute;rat&aacute;ng Island from Middle Andaman,
and joins the Andaman at its western mouth. It is intricate and
rocky, but has good depths, except at the eastern entrance, where
there is a broad bar of 8 feet. The tidal stream is weak, and
the narrowest part is 60 yards across.</p>

<p>The surface of Great Andaman is extremely irregular, and
a central range of mountains runs from north to south, with an
escarped face on the east, and a sloping declivity on the west,
where marshy localities abound.</p>

<p>The highest point is Saddle Hill (2400 feet) in North
Andaman: Mount Harriet (1200 feet) stands on the north shore
of Port Blair; and Ford's Peak, in Rutland Island, rises 1400 feet;
while there are half a dozen unnamed summits with heights
between 1000 feet and 1700 feet.</p>

<p>Narkondam rises 2330 feet, from an oval-shaped base whose
greatest diameter is 2 miles, and the crater walls of Barren
Island, 2 square miles in area, attain an elevation of 1158
feet.</p>

<p>Little Andaman, some 25 miles south of Rutland, 23 miles
long and 17 miles wide, with an area of about 220 square miles,
is, on the contrary, level throughout, and gradually rises to a
height of 600 feet in the centre. None of the other islands save
Rutland attain this elevation.</p>

<p>Owing to its shape and conformation, there are no rivers and
but few streams on Great Andaman, and during the dry season&mdash;January
to April&mdash;there is some scarcity of water. Several
creeks, however, are of sufficient depth to allow passage of boats
for some distance into the interior. In the South Andaman
the greater part of the drainage runs into the creeks, which
ultimately leads off to the eastern shore, and in the North and
Middle Andaman the bulk of the drainage seems to flow through
gaps in the eastern range.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Andaman is swampy in many parts, and possesses a
few small creeks.</p>

<p>On the western side, in which direction Great Andaman slopes
gradually, banks of coral occur at distances of 20 and 25 miles
from land. There are three of these, varying in length from 9
to 25 miles, all composed of dead coral and sand, with here and
there single bunches of live coral 1 or 2 feet high. The
water, which is so clear that on a calm day 8 or 9 fathoms looks
like 20 feet, varies in its least depths from 3&frac34; to 6 fathoms,
and, judged from the appearance of the bottom and the absence
of reef-building coral, it seems probable that the surface <i>d&eacute;bris</i>
of the banks is disturbed by the send of the sea, and that the
rollers topple and break on the middle bank in the south-west
monsoon, though they may not do so on the others.</p>

<p>This western coast is fully exposed to the south-west monsoon,
and is by no means a desirable locality to be in at that
season.</p>

<p>Dalrymple Bank, of the same nature, lies adjacent to Little
Andaman, on the same side; but Invisible Bank, to the eastward,
has depths of 17 to 50 fathoms, with a rock awash in the centre.
This is of bluish-grey sandstone, so that the Bank, taking into
account its irregular surface and the rapidly-increasing depths
around, may be considered a submerged mountain-range, of the
same formation as the oldest part of the Andamans&mdash;of which,
Flat Rock, an isolated peak, rises alone above the sea. All
these banks probably formed islands, or part of the Andamans,
when the latter stood at a higher elevation than they do to-day.</p>

<p>Throughout the Archipelago the scenery is of exceeding
beauty. The picturesquely undulating surface is clad everywhere,
save where artificial clearings have been made, with the
most luxuriant jungle, for, situated within the tropics, with a
fertile soil, and a climate that for two-thirds of the year is
somewhat moist, the islands are covered from hill-top to sea-beach
with an unbroken mantle of dense vegetation, rendered
almost impenetrable by cane-brakes and undergrowth of rattans
and other creepers. All along the shores are either stretches of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
yellow sand or brilliant green mangroves, and the seas round
the islands are of the clearest water imaginable.</p>

<p>The coast-line is everywhere deeply indented, and affords a
number&mdash;most unusual for such a small group&mdash;of deep-water
harbours and other anchorages, where complete shelter can be
found for large ships in all weathers and seasons. The most
known and the best&mdash;although Port Cornwallis is nearly as good,
and has the advantage of being some twelve hours' steaming
nearer to Calcutta and Rangoon&mdash;is Port Blair, where the
Settlement has been placed; but on the same coast of Great
Andaman are many others, the more important being, Macpherson's
Straits, Shoal Bay, Port Meadows, Colebrooke Passage,
and Stewart's Sound. On the west coast are situated, Port
Andaman, Kwang-tung Harbour, Ports Campbell and Mouat,
while in the Archipelago perfect anchorage is to be found either
in Outram Harbour or in Charka-Juru,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Kwang-tung Strait, or
Tadma-Juru.</p>

<p>These are well distributed all along the coasts, and were the
Andamans situated in some position of greater political or
commercial importance, they would form an invaluable possession
for this reason. As it is, the islands are exploited merely as a
convict establishment&mdash;an Indian Botany Bay&mdash;and the only
industry of any magnitude appertaining to them is that of
timber, for which indeed the harbours are very convenient, as
the forests worked are all in the neighbourhood of the seashore,
or are so placed that after the trees are felled the logs can be
hauled by elephants to the many creeks, and floated down to
where the vessels engaged in the business are anchored.</p>

<p>The geographical conditions, and more especially the Tertiary
sandstone of which the large area of the islands consists, point
to a former connection with Arakan, and, in accordance with
these indications, it is found that the bulk of the flora is
Burmese; but the forest trees are finer, being very lofty and
straight, while not a few purely Malayan species find their
northern limit in the Andamans. The flora is not related to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
that of Hindustan and India proper&mdash;a coincidence which can
be partly explained by the insular climate and difference of soil.</p>

<p>The forests produce valuable woods, which can be used for
many trade purposes&mdash;furniture; ship, boat and house building;
railway carriages and sleepers; paving blocks, boxes, gun-carriages
and stocks, pianos, etc.; and as profitable minor
products, there are canes for furniture, rattans for walking-sticks,
and gurjan oil. Some of the woods can be obtained in
extremely large quantities; all possibly in sufficiency for any
trade that may arise with the islands.</p>

<p>Palms abound; the banian and padouk, that resembles
mahogany; marble-wood, of a black, mottled appearance; satin-wood;
and the iron tree, which turns the edge of an axe, are all
found in the forests, in beautiful confusion with cotton-trees,
screw-pines, and arborescent euphorbias, and with large clumps
of bamboos, 30 and 40 feet high; while all round the coasts,
mangroves, the most satisfactory of firewoods, give shelter to
lovely orchids.</p>

<p>A very conspicuous feature of the forests is the distribution
(apart from the strictly littoral vegetation) into evergreen forest,
very full of large gurjan trees (<i>Dipterocarpe&aelig;</i>), and a leaf-shedding
forest, containing a large proportion of padouk (<i>Pterocarpus
dalbergioides</i>), or into a mixture of these two types.</p>

<p>The great peculiarity of the Andaman flora is that, with the
exception of the Cocos Islands, which are covered with them,
and thence indeed derive their name, no coconut palms naturally
propagated are found in the Archipelago.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> This is the more
strange when it is remembered that all the shores of the Bengal
Sea are the home of this tree, and that it simply teems in all
the islands of the Nicobar group to the south. During the past
thirty-five years advantage has been taken of trips in the Station
steamer (or by other means) to plant coconuts at suitable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
localities<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> along the coasts of Great Andaman, and in recent
years at Little Andaman. Great numbers of the nuts were
consumed by the aborigines, or by wild pigs, but at several
places fruit has been obtainable, for many years past, from trees
which escaped destruction.</p>

<p>The climate of the Andamans is equatorial in its uniformity,
and greatly resembles that of Tenasserim and Mergui. It is not
generally healthy for Europeans, but improves from a hygienic
point of view when the forest is cleared from any locality. During
the first two months of the dry season strong winds blow from the
north-east, causing sickness, and damage to vegetation.</p>

<p>As the islands are exposed to the full force of the south-west
monsoon, only four months of fair weather (January to April)
can be counted on. December and January are the coolest
months, with a mean temperature of 79&deg; and a mean minimum
of 75&deg;, while March and April are the warmest, with means of
82&deg; and 83&deg; respectively, and a mean daily maximum of 92&deg;
at Port Blair, where throughout the year the mean is 80&deg;, the
highest 96&deg;, and the lowest 66&deg;; so that the absolute range is 30&deg;.
The mean diurnal range is as much as 14&deg; to 15&deg; in February,
March, and April, while between June and September it is only
8&deg; or 9&deg;. The mean temperature throughout the year is about 80&deg;.</p>

<p>The south-west monsoon sets in, accompanied by heavy rain,
in the early part of May, but occasionally in April, and lasts
till October. March is the driest month, and January and
February somewhat less so; but the rainy season lasts from
the middle of May till the middle of October, and what is called
the moderate season, from October to January. During the latter
the average monthly rainfall is about 8 inches; in the rainy
season it is 16 inches, with twenty-four rainy days per month;
while, on the average, throughout the dry season rain falls on
ten days to an extent of 5 inches. At Port Blair the mean
humidity is 83 per cent, and the average annual rainfall is 117
inches; but elsewhere it varies from 100 to 155 inches, and there
are about 180 wet days in the year.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>At the change of the monsoons stormy weather is common,
and the neighbourhood of the Andamans is considered to be
the birthplace of many of the violent cyclones that occasionally
visit the Indian and Burmese coasts of the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>The hurricanes generally both originate either between
Ceylon or the N.W. portion of the bay, and take various
courses, according to the season; but, although situated near
the cradle of these storms, the islands are not often traversed
by them. In 1864 one is recorded as having visited the locality,
and on the night of November 1st, 1891, a violent cyclone passed
over Port Blair, which, after travelling north-westward across
the bay, did much further damage at the mouth of the Hugli
and on the Orissa coast. The maximum velocity of the wind
registered at Port Blair on the latter occasion was 111 miles.</p>

<p>Concerning the geology of the islands, it is curious that in
the valley of the Irrawadi hot springs and other evidence of
volcanic action occur in the same relative position to the Arakan
Hills as the two islands of Narkondam and Barren Island
occupy in respect to the Andamans. There seems little doubt
that these two islands&mdash;now respectively extinct and quiescent&mdash;belong
to the great line of volcanic disturbance that appears
in Lower Burma and extends right through Sumatra and
Java and the further islands of the Malay Archipelago. Thus
it would seem that the Andamans proper, possessed of no
volcanoes themselves, lie just outside the line of activity, and,
with the Nicobars, occupy the same position with regard to
the volcanic track as do the chain of islands west of Sumatra.</p>

<p>Possibly the land now constituting the Andamans first
appeared above the sea as an extension of Cape Negrais in
the latter part of the Tertiary epoch, at which time occurred
the elevation of the Arakan Yoma Hills, and later became
isolated by subsidence due to neighbouring volcanic action.
As Mr A. R. Wallace points out,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> the presence of active volcanoes
produces subsidence of the surrounding area by the weight of
every fresh deposit of materials ejected either in the sea or on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>land. "The subsidence such materials produce around them
will, in time, make a sea if one does not already exist."</p>

<p>The Andamans are of Tertiary formation, and of similar
geological structure to the Arakan Yoma Range, the line of
elevation connecting them with which is represented by the
Alguada Reef and Preparis Island. (The Cocos are an integral
part of the Andamans.)</p>

<p>Two sedimentary formations have been distinguished up
to the present, the one older, the other newer than the serpentine
which intrudes in various localities. They have been called
the Port Blair and Archipelago series respectively.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>The former, occurring in the south, consists of fine grey
sandstone&mdash;the characteristic rock, generally non-calcareous&mdash;and
beds of conglomerate and limestone as subsidiary members;
red and green jasper also occur; possibly, however, of an older
series than the sandstone in which they crop out. This series
seems to be of early Tertiary or later age.</p>

<p>The second series,&mdash;Miocene, or even newer&mdash;of which the
whole of the islands of the Archipelago are formed, consist
typically of soft limestone, of coral and shell-sand, soft calcareous
sandstones, and soft white clay, with occasionally a band
of conglomerate, the pebbles of which seem to have been coral.</p>

<p>The intrusive rocks of the Andamans&mdash;similar to those of
Manipur and Burma in the north, and the Nicobars to the
south, and of later date than the Port Blair series&mdash;are of
serpentine, often passing into crystalline diorite and gabbro.</p>

<p>The Archipelago series seem to cover a large area of the
Andamans, while the Port Blair formation is restricted to the
south. The greater part of Rutland Island is formed of serpentine,
in which small layers of brown opal have been met with,
and which throughout the group seems disseminated with
minute crystals of chromium. The Cinques consist of intrusive
rocks of serpentine, associated with metamorphosed, indurated,
and sedimentary series, mostly calcareous. The rocks of Little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>Andaman are chiefly lime and sandstone, with a good deal of
actual coral rock on the east and south coasts; while occasionally
occur outcrops of an igneous nature. At Entry Island and Port
Meadows, beds of volcanic origin exist.</p>

<p>In view of the connection with them, the apparent barrenness
of the Arakan Hills goes to show that little may be expected
from the Andamans in the way of mineral products. Amongst
others, however, discoveries have been made of lignite, and
the ores of chromium, copper, iron, and <i>sulphur</i>,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> although not
in quantities that would pay commercial development.</p>

<p>It is indubitable, as Kurz has shown,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> that the Andamans
are now undergoing subsidence; but there is ample evidence,
in the raised coral beaches that fringe the shores, to show that
in the immediate past this has been exceeded by elevation.</p>

<p>The islands have been subjected to earthquakes from time
to time. The first recorded took place in August 1868, the
next in February 1880, and several slight shocks occurred until
December 1881, when a severe earthquake visited the group,
made itself felt over a large area of the Bengal Sea and
surrounding countries, did much damage to masonry at Port
Blair, and raised waves 3 feet high, following each other at fifteen-minute
intervals for a period of twenty-one hours. Another slight
shock was experienced in February 1882.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The origin of the name Andaman appears to be somewhat
doubtful, and it is, of course, a word unknown to the natives.
It is, however, very old, and may&mdash;as Sir Henry Yule suggests in
his Commentary on Marco Polo&mdash;perhaps be traced to Ptolemy
(who flourished at Alexandria soon after the commencement of
the Christian era), and if so, we have by him the first-known
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
reference to the Archipelago, for he mentions a group of islands
under the name of Good Fortune,
&#913;&#947;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#925;&#951;&#948;&#959;&#962;,
or the like&mdash;"The Angdaman Islands"&mdash;whence have come the names
Agdaman, Angdaman, Andaman. Even at this early date the
inhabitants were said to be cannibals.</p>

<p>Doubtless the Chinese knew of the group in comparatively
early times, for they have records of the neighbouring Nicobar
Islands going back for more than a thousand years.</p>

<p>Skipping a long period, we next come to the ninth century,
and there have the accounts of Arab travellers (<small>A.D.</small> 871), which,
although of an alarming description, are tolerably correct in some
details. "The people eat human flesh quite raw; their complexion
is black, their hair frizzled, their countenance and eyes
frightful, their feet very large, and almost a cubit in length, and
they go quite naked." Those ships, the story goes on to say,
which have been set back by contrary winds, and compelled to
anchor for the sake of water, commonly lose some of their men
on these barbarous coasts, and it is fortunate that the natives
have no ships or other vessels, otherwise they would seize and
devour all the passengers.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Reference to the Andamans in the thirteenth-century
narrative of Marco Polo is very much of a traveller's tale.
"Angamanain is a very large island. The people are without
a king, and are idolaters, and no better than wild beasts. All
the men of this island have heads like dogs, and teeth and eyes
likewise; in fact, in face they are just like big mastiff dogs!
They have a quantity of spices; but they are a most cruel
generation, and eat everybody they can catch not of their own
race. They live on flesh, and rice and milk, and have fruits
different from ours." Colonel Yule suggests that Angamanain
is an Arabic (oblique) dual, indicating "The two Andamans,"
viz., "The Great and the Little."</p>

<p>In 1563, Master C&aelig;sar Frederike set out on his travels, and
returning homeward three years later, passed near the Nicobars
on his way from Malacca to Goa. "From Nicobar to Pegu is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
as it were, a row or chain of islands, an infinite number, of
which many are inhabited with wild people; and they call those
islands the Islands of Andemaon, and their people savage or
wild, because they eat one another. Also, these islands have
war one with another; for they have small barques, and with
them they take one another, and eat one another: and if by
evil chance any ship be lost on those islands, as many have been,
there is not one man of those ships that escapeth uneaten or
unslain. These people have not any acquaintance with any
other people, neither have they trade with any, but live only
on such fruits as the islands yield."<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>An Italian doctor, John Francis Gemelli, who made a
voyage round the world, touched at the Nicobars in 1695, and
refers incidentally to the neighbouring group. "Friday the 3rd,
we were in sight of the island of Nicobar. The island pays an
annual tribute of a certain number of human bodies to the
island of Andemaon, to be eaten by the natives of it. These
brutes rather than men, use, when they have wounded an enemy,
to run greedily to suck the blood that runs. The Dutch are
witness of this cruelty of theirs; for they, going with fire-ships
to subdue them, and landing 800 men, though they were well
entrenched to defend themselves against those wild people, yet
they were most of them killed, very few having the good
fortune to fly to their ships.... The chief motive of the
Dutch to attempt the conquest of that island, was a report
spread abroad that there was a well in that island whose water
converted iron into gold, and was the true philosopher's stone....
No man in Europe or Asia can give any certain account of
it, because those people have no commerce with any nation in
the world." This vanished wonder was discovered by an English
vessel that was driven to the islands; for a native who was
carrying a shell of water accidentally spilt some of the contents
on the anchor, and the part so wetted immediately turned into
gold! The narrative goes on to say that the unhappy native,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
who thus by his clumsiness revealed the priceless secret, was
immediately killed, not by his countrymen, as might perhaps be
expected, but by the strangers! There is no mention of torture;
but the well was neither discovered then nor since.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The next historian is an Englishman, for Captain Alexander
Hamilton, in his <i>Account of the East Indies</i>,<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> written about
1700, devotes some space to these islands. "The Andamans
are surrounded by many dangerous rocks and banks, and they
are all inhabited with cannibals, who are so fearless that they
will swim off to a boat if she approach near the shore, and
attack her with their wooden weapons, notwithstanding the
superiority of numbers in the boat and the advantages of
missive and defensive arms of iron, steel, and fire."</p>

<p>As an example of this, Hamilton tells of one, Captain Ferguson,
whose ship, bound from Malacca to Bengal, in company with
another, was driven by a strong current on some rocks, and
lost. The second vessel was carried through a channel, and
was completely powerless to aid those shipwrecked, "which," says
our author, "gave ground to conjecture that they were all
devoured by those savage cannibals."</p>

<p>This same chronicler met a native of the Andamans at
Acheen in 1694, and says of the incident: "The Andamaners
had a yearly custom to come to the Nicobar Islands with a
great number of small praus, and kill and take prisoners as
many Nicobarians as they could overcome." During one of
these raids, however, the long-suffering Nicobarese armed themselves&mdash;it
does not seem to have been their custom to resist&mdash;and,
gathering together, gave battle to the invaders, and utterly
defeated them; and on this occasion the man under discussion,
then a boy of ten or twelve years, who had accompanied his
father, was taken prisoner, and, spared on account of his youth,
was made a slave.</p>

<p>Some years went by, and he was sold to the Achinese, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
being Mohammedans, taught him their religion; and he
remained in Sumatra, until, on the occasion of his master's
death, he was manumitted.</p>

<p>He had now become very homesick, and so, obtaining a boat,
he set out during the fine season from the islands of Gomus
(Pulo Bras) and Pulo-weh. "From here the furthermost of the
Nicobars may be seen, and so one island may be seen from
another, from the southernmost of those to Chitty-Andeman
(Little Andaman), which is southernmost of the Andamans,
distant from Acheen about a hundred leagues." Once home,
and made much of by his relatives, who recognised him although
he had long been considered dead, he acquainted them with his
knowledge of God, "and would have persuaded his countrymen
to learn of him how to adore God and to obey His laws, but
he could make no converts."</p>

<p>After a month or so of the old life, he returned to Acheen
with a quantity of quicksilver, which, he said, abounded in some
of the Andamans; and thereafter he made several other voyages,
always returning with a similar cargo. "Some Mohammedan
faquirs would have accompanied him, but he would not suffer
them, because, he said, he could not engage for their safety
among his countrymen. When I saw him he was in company
of a seid, whom I carried as a passenger to Surat, and from
whom I had this account of his adventures."</p>

<p>Trustworthy history of the islands now begins; for, at the
close of the eighteenth century, the Honourable East India
Company sent small expeditions, under Colonel Colebrooke and
Captain Blair, to report on the possibilities of the group. Their
accounts were so satisfactory, that, in 1789, the latter was sent to
establish a penal settlement in what was then called Port
Cornwallis&mdash;now Port Blair.</p>

<p>All went well with Blair and his colony until 1792, when
orders were received from Calcutta to transfer the whole establishment
to the harbour in North Andaman, which, in turn, was
to be known as Port Cornwallis. The first place of that name
was henceforth for a time dubbed Old Harbour.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Syme, who was sent on a mission to Ava in 1795,
visited the establishment on his voyage out, and found there
a population of 700, including a company of sepoys. He estimated
the aborigines at 2000 to 2500, and gives a very unflattering
description of them. They then used rafts of bamboo in addition
to canoes.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The new settlement proved so unhealthy, that, after an
existence of four years, its abandonment was decided on: the
prisoners were transferred to Penang, and the troops returned
to Bengal.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>For many years now, the group remained untenanted by a
foreign element, and its isolation was broken only by the
rendezvous at Port Cornwallis, in 1824, of the fleet carrying the
army of Sir Archibald Campbell to Rangoon for the first
Burmese war; by the murder, while ascertaining the mineral
possibilities of the islands, of Dr Heifer, a Russian scientist
employed by the H.E.I.C.; and by the simultaneous wrecks in
1844, on Sir John Lawrence Island, of the troopships <i>Runnymede</i>
and <i>Briton</i>, which, in a hurricane one inky night, were flung,
unknown to each other until morning dawned, right over the
reef in among the trees of the jungle. Hardly a life was
lost.</p>

<p>Before the Andamans again became the field of Government
activity, the Cocos group, which lie 20 miles to the north of Great
Andaman, were the scene of an unofficial attempt at colonisation.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
The first settlers were two men on their way to Australia, who,
struck with the beauty of the Great Coco, with its shore covered
with innumerable coco palms and other trees, gave up their
original plan, and were left there in the early part of 1849. There
were no inhabitants; but the islands were frequented during the
north-east monsoon by people from Tenasserim and Arakan, who
came for the coconuts that were so plentiful. The only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
animals were rats; but the bays abounded with fish and turtle,
and water was obtained by sinking wells in the beach.</p>

<p>In the middle of July, the <i>Flying Fish</i>&mdash;the ship that had
landed the first settlers&mdash;brought a second batch from Moulmein,
and the population then consisted of four men, two women, and
four children, with a small number of Burmese and a few
Lascars.</p>

<p>Some months passed, and the island remained unvisited;
and the whole story of that time is one of incompetence, laziness,
sickness, and starvation. Stores failed; while food procurable on
the island only consisted of turtles, turtles' eggs, fish, and coconuts.
The settlers were, besides, suffering from dysentery,
fever, and other complaints, brought on by an unaccustomed mode
of life, in dwellings that were mere hovels, and subjection to the
inclemency of the rainy season. Their spirits became depressed,
and despair succeeding discontent, they were more like an unfortunate
shipwrecked party than immigrants who had landed
to make a new home. Several of the colonists fell a prey to
despondency, that in some cases amounted almost to mental
derangement. Some of them died, and those who were rescued
from that fate were brought away from the island in an utter
state of destitution, emaciated in body and almost silly in
intellect.</p>

<p>On October 29 the remaining settlers&mdash;of whom seven had
died&mdash;were taken off, and reconveyed to Moulmein by the
Company's ship <i>Proserpine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>In 1855, measures were proposed at Calcutta&mdash;for the
Andamans were then an appanage of the East India Company&mdash;for
the repression of the outrages practised by the Andamanese
on those crews shipwrecked on their shores, and two years later&mdash;on
the conclusion of the Mutiny&mdash;it was determined that a
penal settlement should once more be established in the group;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
thus combining a headquarters, from whence the pacification of
the aborigines might be undertaken, with an abode of punishment
for such mutineers and others whose offences had not
merited the death penalty.</p>

<p>It was at this date that Dr F. J. Mouat, who has given an
account of his visit in <i>Adventures and Researches among the
Andaman Islanders</i>, was sent, as head of a Commission, to
examine the islands and select a suitable locality for the establishment
of a penal settlement. The Commission spent about
three weeks steaming about the coasts of the Archipelago, and
finally decided on Old Harbour, to which they gave the name of
Port Blair, in honour of its former resident.</p>

<p>A rather amusing incident occurred during the visit:&mdash;A
nervous and imaginative member of an exploring party brought
news of the proximity of a native village and a lurking body
of aborigines. The doctor, without waiting for further information,
or to be attacked, addressed his followers in a warlike
speech, and gave the order to charge, which the company forthwith
did with such vigour that two fiery spirits were knocked
senseless by contact with burnt tree-stumps&mdash;a number of which
the party had mistaken for natives. The expedition had,
however, several serious conflicts with the aborigines, in which
a few of the latter were killed.</p>

<p>On return of the Commission to Calcutta their advice was
soon acted on, and the late General (then Captain) H. Man was
sent to Port Blair to formally re-annex the Andamans and put
matters in train, and following him a body of convicts arrived
in charge of Dr J. P. Walker, who was appointed first Superintendent.</p>

<p>For some years the death-rate was excessive (averaging 18
per cent.), owing to the necessity of pushing forward clearing
and building operations, and it was not until 1868, soon after
the appointment of Colonel Man as Superintendent, that it fell
to a more normal level (average for ten years, 2.7 per cent.).</p>

<p>The pacification of the natives, by means of Homes, a school,
and visits paid to the tribes by the Station gunboat, went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
steadily on, until there now remain but two or three groups of
Andamanese from whom any hostility is to be feared.</p>

<p>In 1872-3 the Andamans were formed in a Commissionership
with the Nicobars, and a year later general attention was
drawn to them by the death of Lord Mayo, Viceroy of India,
at the hands of a convict.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The Andaman Islands are inhabited by people of pure Negrito
blood, members of perhaps the most ancient race remaining on
the earth, and standing closest to the primitive human type.</p>

<p>Geologically, the islands are connected with the opposite
mainland, so that in remote times migration was probably possible;
and we find in the Malay Peninsula, and in the Philippines, which
were at one time connected with it, aborigines who&mdash;known by
various names, such as Semang, Jakun, etc., and Aeta&mdash;are the
nearest existing relatives of the Andamanese.</p>

<p>There is no reason to consider the Andamanese any other
than the aborigines of the islands, for we know from their
kitchen-middens, which are found throughout the group, that
they occupied it in very remote times.</p>

<p>From the examination of fragments of pottery, arrowheads,
and other stone implements discovered in the shell-mounds, it is
now believed that the locality was settled some time during the
Pleistocene period, and certainly not later than the Neolithic age.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"In the Andaman kitchen-middens have been found shells,
pig-bones, pottery (referred to a stone age&mdash;at least to the
Neolithic period&mdash;and almost identical with the fragments found
in the Danish kitchen-middens), and stone implements. Every
second stone picked up showed indications of being used in some
way; some as hammers, others fastened to wood as rude hatchets,
knives, etc.: a beautiful polished celt was found, indistinguishable
from European or Indian celts of the Neolithic period, also a
typical arrow-head&mdash;all of Tertiary sandstone."&mdash;Stoliczka.</p></div>

<p>The possession by the natives, in recent times, of implements
and weapons manufactured from wood and shells only, is easily
accounted for by their having found these equally suitable to
their needs, and far easier to construct.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be impossible to find anywhere a race of purer
descent than the Andamanese, for ever since they peopled the
islands in the Stone Age, they have remained secluded from the
outer world, and to this isolation is due the uniformity so marked
in their physical and mental characteristics.</p>

<p>In stature they are far below the average height; but although
they have been called dwarfs and pygmies, these words must
not be understood to imply anything in the nature of a monstrosity.
Their reputation for hideousness, like their poisoned
arrows and cannibalism, has long been a fallacy, which, although
widely popular, should now be exploded.</p>

<p>The average heights of Andamanese men and women, computed
from a large series of measurements, are found to be 4 feet
10&frac34; inches and 4 feet 7&frac14; inches respectively, and their figures
which are proportionately built, are very symmetrical and graceful.
Although not to be described as muscular, they are of good
development, the men being agile, yet sturdy, with broad chests
and square shoulders.</p>

<p>The abdomens&mdash;although on the whole not to a greater
extent than those of other savages&mdash;are sometimes protuberant,
in the women more so than the men, and it is probably owing
to this feature that they have been described as figureless, a
statement by no means wholly correct.</p>

<p>In both sexes, the small of the back is very hollow and the
buttocks prominent. The feet are rather large, and occasionally
occurs a case of the great-toe being placed with relation to the
others in an almost simian or thumb-like way. Hands are of
moderate size and well shaped, with long thin fingers.</p>

<p>Viewed from a distance, the skin appears of a jetty colour,
especially when shining from the fat with which it is often
bedaubed: a close examination shows, however, that it is not
absolutely black, although these people are amongst the darkest
of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Soles, palms, and nails are pale pinkish-brown, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
while the lips of some show a slight purplish tinge, those of the
majority scarcely differ in tint from the skin of the face.</p>

<p>The hair, which is similar in colour to the skin, and lustreless,
is woolly, and of what is known as "pepper-corn" type, for, when
kept short, it assumes the form of little knobs with bare spaces
between, giving to the head an appearance that has been rather
aptly likened to that of an old worn-out shoe-brush. When long,
the tufts take the form of a cone-shaped frizzly spiral. The body
is glabrous, but there are traces of hair about the armpits and
other parts, and adult males possess sometimes an excessively
slight moustache, and about a dozen hairs on the tip of the chin.</p>

<p>The skull is mesocephalous, with an index of about 82; the
forehead of good size, round and prominent; the face rather
short, and often quadrilateral. The nose is somewhat broad,
with rounded tip and nostrils, often short, and, when not straight,
as is most common, is as frequently convex as concave. The
eyes are large, horizontal, and placed widely apart, with black
pupils and muddy yellow sclerotic; and the lips, which are well-formed
and neither excessively prominent nor thick, are kept
closed when at rest, and cover teeth strong though irregular
and often stained from use of tobacco. The ears are of good
shape, small, and lie close to the head.</p>

<p>Their speech is rapid and vivacious. Each tribe possesses a
distinct dialect, traceable, however, to the same source.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The Andamanese languages are one group, and have no
affinities by which we might infer their connection with any other
known group. They belong to the agglutinative stage of development,
and are distinguished from other groups by the presence,
in full development, of the principle of prefixed and affixed
grammatical additions to the roots of words. Their form of
speech is extremely intricate; for instance, the possessive pronouns
have as many as sixteen possible variants according to the class
of noun with which they are in agreement. There is also a
distinct poetical dialect, and in their songs they subordinate to
rhythm, not only the form of words, but even the grammatical
construction of sentences."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p></div>

<span class="caption">&Ouml;NG&Eacute; MAN, LITTLE ANDAMAN.</span>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p>They have words for the numerals "one" and "two" only,
but can count to ten by tapping the nose with the finger-tips of
both hands, uttering for each in turn the word <i>an-k&aacute;</i> = "and this,"
until, when the last is reached, the expression <i>&aacute;rd&uacute;ru</i> implies
"all."</p>

<p>In disposition they are childish, but bright and merry, though
petulant, quick-tempered, and restless, and not capable of much
perseverance. Great affection is lavished on children and the
young; old or helpless are held in high consideration. Women
are well treated, and not used as drudges or slaves, but are
assisted by the men, who assume a fair share of the day's
work.</p>

<p>In the school that at one time existed at Port Blair for the
Andamanese, it was found, that, as with all savages, the children,
when educated were as proficient up to a certain age as the
children of civilised peoples, but that point reached, they possessed
no capacity for imbibing further knowledge.</p>

<p>As the natives gain by education in intelligence and tractability,
they become fat and indolent, while their morals undergo
much deterioration through contact with the convicts. The
clearance of the jungle has been prejudicial to their health,
and excessive tobacco-smoking among both sexes, which has
been unrestricted, has seriously undermined their already enfeebled
constitutions.</p>

<p>They possess very little vital power, and readily succumb to
diseases, suffering much from febrile disorders, which give rise
to pulmonary complaints&mdash;the chief cause of mortality among
them. Very few reach the age of fifty, and the average duration
of life is little over twenty years. Of the lesser ailments, skin
diseases are very common.</p>

<p>Measles, to which over 20 per cent. of the population fell
victims in 1877, was followed by an outbreak of syphilis, both
introduced by convicts. The latter disease has caused much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
injury, and its spread has, it is believed, been greatly accelerated
by the custom prevailing of the women suckling each other's
children.</p>

<p>The "sense of shame" is but little developed, and the natives
pay no attention to their own nudity, although by nature
they are modest. Of the various objects worn, those only
coming under the heading of clothing are the aprons or leaves
worn with the girdle by the women, and always carefully
adjusted.</p>

<p>Previous to marriage, which is not permitted to those between
whom any degree of consanguinity can be traced, unchastity is
the rule with both sexes. Births out of wedlock, however, are
considered discreditable, and marriage generally follows on a
girl becoming <i>enceinte</i>, in which case there seems no objection
on the part of the lover to become the husband.</p>

<p>Once married, conjugal fidelity until death is the rule, and
bigamy, polygamy, and divorce are unknown.</p>

<p>Restrictions from various tabooed articles of food, which begin
at puberty and often last for years, are brought to a conclusion
after a long series of initiatory ceremonies undergone by both
sexes.</p>

<p>When a death occurs, the corpse is buried with a method
and ceremonies differing somewhat according as to whether it
be adult or child;<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> and after some months, during which the
encampment in which the death took place is deserted, the
body is exhumed, and the bones cleaned and made into
souvenirs, which are distributed to relatives and friends.</p>

<p>Numerous superstitions are extant among them, and there
is credence in wizardry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 421px;">

<span class="caption">ANDAMANESE OBJECTS.</span>
</div>

<p>No form of worship is to be found; but there exists a belief
in a spiritual being, called <i>P&uacute;luga</i>, the Creator; and in evil
spirits, <i>&Eacute;rem-chaugala</i>, the spirit of the woods; and <i>Juruwinda</i>,
the spirit of the sea, the first of whom causes sickness and earthquakes,
the latter cramp; both are demoniacal. There are also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
a host of minor devils, who are self-created; none of the demons
are under the control of <i>P&uacute;luga</i>.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>They make no attempt at trading in the natural products of
their islands, and manufacture nothing but the weapons, personal
ornaments, implements, and utensils required for their own use.
They have some knowledge of pottery, though not of the wheel,
and make rude pots, which they ornament with patterns of wavy
lines before baking.</p>

<p>No true musical instruments exist, but a rude sounding-board
is constructed, on which they accompany songs by beating
with the foot.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>The weapons used in hunting and fishing are bows and spears,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and there are both hand and large seine nets for taking fish.
For food there are pigs, musang, dugong, porpoise, fish, turtle
and their eggs, molluscs, larv&aelig; (a delicacy), fruit, honey, and
roots. Food is cooked and eaten as hot as possible: of the production
of fire they, at least in modern times, have no knowledge:
this accounts for the great care taken in preserving fire at their
camping places, and when travelling.</p>

<p>The coast people are extremely expert swimmers and divers,
but the interior tribes naturally not so, as their mode of life is
somewhat different.</p>

<p>The natives are now known to be divided into twelve tribes,
if groups that in many cases number at present less than fifty
individuals can be so called. Beyond their speech there is
little otherwise to distinguish them from each other, except
in the case of the &Ouml;ng&eacute;s and Jarawas, who differ somewhat
from the rest, but are in many ways both alike.</p>

<p>The enmity that the Andamanese had ever shown to all
strangers was by some believed to have been greatly due to
the treatment they had received from early Chinese and Malay
traders, or <i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i> collectors; but, prior to 1858, extreme
jealousy and distrust prevailed among adjacent tribes, and
even amongst scattered communities of the same tribe, and
it was not till 1879 that members of all the Andaman tribes
(except &Ouml;ng&eacute;s and Jarawas) were able to meet on friendly
terms at the Homes of the Settlement.</p>

<p>Friendly relations have lately been arrived at with most of the
inhabitants of Little Andaman (<i>i.e.</i> the &Ouml;ng&eacute;s), but the Jarawas, who
inhabit the North Sentinel, Rutland Island, and South Andaman,
have proved to be quite irreconcilable, and their attitude often
explains the total disappearance that sometimes follows escapes
of the convicts.</p>

<p>They are generally feared by all their native neighbours
and, with the boldness of ignorance, do not hesitate still to
attack even superior numbers of Europeans, as an instance
that occurred during the late census operations shows.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 447px;">
<img src="images/fp190.jpg" width="447" height="616" alt="" title="" />
<span class="caption">&Ouml;NG&Eacute; VISITOR AT RUTLAND ISLAND.</span>
</div>

<p>At Port Campbell a body of natives were seen who were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
pronounced to be Jarawas, and, as it was considered to be a
suitable opportunity to attempt to establish friendly relations
with them, the census party made for the shore, in a boat
manned by Andamanese, taking with them a quantity of
presents, a rifle, and some boards and cushions to serve as
shields in case of hostilities, and an Andamanese woman, whose
shrill cries it was hoped might prove to the savages pacific
intentions. The crew, as usual, took their bows and arrows,
but carefully concealed them, and, as the boat approached the
shore, all waved handkerchiefs and large pieces of red cloth,
much appreciated by the other Andamanese, while the woman
loudly and unceasingly screamed friendly messages. But it was
soon apparent that the Jarawas meant fighting, for they sent
their women and children away to a distance, and then three
of the men, armed with bows and arrows, and with threatening
cries and gestures, waded out towards the boat, 100 yards
distant, through the shallow water intervening. The three
advanced in line, at intervals of about fifteen paces, and placed
themselves so that the centre man could rake the boat and
the others shoot into it from either side.</p>

<p>No arms were shown from the boat, but friendly signs persevered
with, until the man on the right flank, who was the
leader, when well within bow-shot, raised his weapon, and as it
was seen that he was evidently in the act of discharging it,
which would have been the signal for the others to follow suit,
the rifle in the boat was fired at him, wounding him in the
thigh. This caused him to spin round and make off towards
the beach, followed by his supports. After running for a short
distance, he fell, and, while his two companions pluckily picked
him up and carried him into the jungle, some of the others,
who had been looking on from the beach, yelled to the women,
with the result that they were seen to return as hurriedly as
possible. As the men on the beach evidently considered themselves
in perfect safety, although only some 300 yards distant,
a second bullet was fired into the sand near them, much to
their astonishment and consternation, as they then and there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
fled into the adjacent jungle with shouts of alarm. The party
in the boat thereupon returned to the launch and steamed out
of the harbour.</p>

<p>It was suspected that these same men were responsible for
the unprovoked murder of a petty officer of an oil-collecting
gang, which had recently taken place near one of the Jarawa
districts.</p>

<p>The population of the islands has been computed from time
to time&mdash;from the 6000 at the period of the founding of the
Settlement&mdash;in variously diminishing numbers down to the
present day, when it is placed at about 1900.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The case affords a striking example of the effect of contact
between civilised and savage man, for only those tribes of the
Andamanese that are still hostile or who have little or no intercourse
with the Government Settlement, have preserved any
respectable number of individuals in their ranks.</p>

<p>Of these, the Jarawas, although not distantly located from the
Settlement, receive all advances with inveterate implacability,
while the &Ouml;ng&eacute;s of Little Andaman, who were until 1884
almost totally unvisited, are further off, and enjoy an insular
position.</p>

<p>These two tribes between them represent by estimation
some 1250 of the total inhabitants of the islands. The numbers
in the various other tribes are now very small, but possibly were
never as large as those of the two mentioned.</p>

<p>Everywhere is noticeable an enormous disproportion between
the numbers of adults and children&mdash;a feature, in view of the
fewness of the former, that argues badly for a much longer
continuance of the race. Concerning the fact, some of the
natives say that it is not due to sickness, but that children are
very seldom born; others state that the first, or first and second
children are dead, and that the one present is the sole survivor.
Undoubtedly, however, the infant mortality that exists is due to
the presence of syphilis, which occurs in some of its most
virulent forms amongst these people, and not to maternal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
neglect, as the mothers display the greatest affection for their
children.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"The Andaman Penal System is the result of the constant
attention of the Government which created it, and is the outcome
of the measures of practical men, devised to meet the
difficulties with which they have found themselves face to face,
and reduced to order and rule by some of the keenest intellects
that have worked in India for many years past. It is no paper
constitution drawn up to suit any particular theories. There
have always been the convicts in their thousands, and there have
been the climate, and the necessity for treating the convicts in
the way best calculated to benefit them, and for so employing
them as to bring down their cost to the taxpayer to the lowest
limits compatible with climatic conditions and beneficial treatment.
Trusted agents of the Government have pondered these
things on the spot in the light of an ever-increasing experience,
and their ideas and suggestions have passed under the criticisms
of highly experienced administrators, and have in the end produced
the system which is now carried out.</p>

<p>"Repeatedly tinkered and patched and recast and remodelled
though it has been, the Andaman System is still inchoate&mdash;still
on its trial as it were. It could not well be otherwise, for in
dealing with the criminal we are attempting to solve a mighty
problem as old as criminality itself, and are plunged, perforce,
into a controversy as contentious now as it was centuries upon
centuries ago.</p>

<p>"From the best estimates to hand, we may take it that the
permanent convict strength of the Settlement may be placed at
about 12,000, of whom about 800 are women, and the rule is
that only life convicts are sent from India, and life and long-term
convicts from Burma. The people received, therefore, are the
murderers who have for some reason escaped the death penalty,
and the perpetrators of the more heinous offences against
person and property&mdash;the men of brutal violence, the highwaymen,
the robbers, the habitual thieves, and the receivers of
stolen goods, the worst of the swindlers, forgers, cheats, coiners,
and such like&mdash;in fact the most unrestrained temperaments of a
continent. These considerations show the scale of the work,
and the nature of the task.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"The convict comes to the Andamans a creature who, by his
life or his acts, has shown himself to be so unfitted for human
society that he has been cast out of it for life, or for a long term
of years. Received thus, he is first subjected for six months to a
most severe discipline&mdash;hard, rigid, uncompromising. He is taught
what it is like to be forced to bend his uncontrolled nature to
the iron yoke of a <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, not of hard toil, but of soul-crushing
monotony. From the stern Cellular Jail he is next transferred to
one of the associated jails, to the comparative blessing of hard
labour, in company with others, but still under a strict discipline.
He works and feeds with others in gangs, and there is a certain
variety in the tasks demanded, but he still sleeps in his separate
cell. Here he stays for a year and a half, and then for the next
three years he is a slave, as the word is ordinarily understood,
locked up with other slaves in barracks at night, but working
in the open at any kind of task that the needs of the Settlement
may require of him, according to his capacity&mdash;an unpaid,
unrewarded labourer, but well fed, housed, clothed, and cared for,
and always under watch and guard. During the following five
years he is still a labouring convict, but the severity of his life is
eased down a little for him. He is now eligible for the petty
posts of supervision, and for the less irksome and less slave-like
forms of labour, and he gets a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;allowance, to
buy a few small luxuries, or to place in the Savings Bank against
future necessities. Having thus served ten long probationary
years, he is eligible, if he has any capacity, to take a ticket-of-leave
and become what is locally known as a self-supporter.</p>

<p>"The convict is now in a sense 'free.' He earns his living in
his own chosen way; he lives in a village, in his own house; he
farms a little land; he keeps cattle; he can move about unwatched;
he can send for his wife and children, or, the far more
frequent course, he can marry a convict woman, who, under her
own regulations, is eligible for marriage. He can thus become
<i>pater familias</i>, with a little hoard of his own earning, and differing
outwardly in no way from the ordinary villager or properly conducted
member of human society. In reality, however, he differs
so greatly, that he misses all those things that 'free' men prize
so highly. He has no civil rights under the ordinary law, and
all the affairs of his life are dealt with by the executive authority.
He must live where he is told; and generally conduct his life as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
he is told; he may move about beyond his village and his fields
by permission only; he cannot leave the Settlement; he may
not be idle, under pain of a forced return to convict labour. In
this state he remains ten or fifteen years, according to the crimes
that have sent him here, until the happy day comes when the
order for absolute release is placed in his hands and he goes free
as other men.</p>

<p>"As in the other portions of his life in transportation, even in
the condition of self-supporter the convict passes through two
distinct stages. In the first stage he is assisted at the beginning
with house, food, and tools, and then by exemption from rent,
taxes, fees, and other cesses payable by the free towards the
common benefit. In the second stage he receives no assistance
whatever, but finds the whole of his means of livelihood, and is
charged with every public payment which would be exacted
from him in his own country.</p>

<p>"The women are dealt with on the same lines, but more gently,
as becomes the gentler sex. For the first three years the convict
woman works in the Female Jail as a mere slave, fed, housed,
clothed, and cared for. Then for two years she is treated to the
same easing down of severity as is granted to the men, and after
a total of five years she is eligible for marriage and domestic
service. Assuming that she marries, she joins her husband in
his village, where she leads the ordinary life of an Indian woman,
but subject to the same disabilities as her husband until she has
completed fifteen years in transportation, when she may go free
with him whithersoever he may go.</p>

<p>"Now through all this long education to useful citizenship there
run continuous threads of practice in self-help and self-restraint,
and of inducement to profit by the practice. The length of the
convict's stay in the Cellular Jail depends entirely on his conduct
in it, and so it remains throughout his career, up to the point of
self-support. Efforts to behave well, and submission to control,
mean promotion upwards from grade to grade in due course.
Every serious lapse means the retarding of promotion, or actual
retrogression. And when he has obtained his ticket-of-leave, it is
to his own effort, his own thrift, his own steadiness, that he has
solely to look for that little hoard which is to be so much to him
when he goes back to his native land&mdash;no pauper, no mere jail-bird,
no unwelcome burden on his relatives, but a self-respecting citizen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
with a little capital of his own earning, for years habituated to
provide for himself in an orderly way, and thoroughly broken to
harness as it were.</p>

<p>"It does not require much imagination to contrast the difference
in the personality of the same human being as he reaches
and leaves Port Blair. He that arrived an outcast, void of
restraint, and unfit for association with his kind on equal terms,
goes forth a useful citizen, broken to restraint, and not only fitted
for human society, but well used to submit to the conventions by
which alone that society can be maintained. And men so reformed
are not sent back to India by ones and twos, but by scores every
year. Every one of the life convicts sent home is such a man.
The incorrigible are kept till death, and the slow to learn are kept
until they mend their ways, while those only that have good in
them, and are capable of reform, are returned to the society they
once disgraced.</p>

<p>"The difference between transportation to Port Blair and
imprisonment in a jail lies in this very matter. While the
Port Blair returned convict is a man fitted to, and habituated
to, support himself, the prisoner released from a jail is not only
a pauper but has became pauperised. That is, he has become
unaccustomed to find for himself, and this disability has grown
upon him with the length of his imprisonment. On this important
ground alone, one cannot help hoping that some day
it may be found feasible to extend the Andaman System to
long-term prisoners from India.</p>

<p>"Besides the direct personal education that the Port Blair
convict receives, he is taught various lessons of general importance
in indirect ways. There is the value of justice, for instance.
For though his life is absolutely controlled by executive officers,
everything that happens to him is the result of a quasi-judicial
procedure. No punishment can be inflicted without a proceeding,
without registration, or without record of the evidence on which
it is awarded. There is a regular course of appeal, and a further
untrammelled appeal to the Head of the Administration himself.
Thus, though the punishments in such a place as Port Blair
must on occasion assume a form of deterrent severity, there is
as much security of justice in award as elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Then there is the system of local marriage. This is no concubinage,
no temporary or irregular alliance. Every inquiry is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
made and every step is taken that is necessary to render convict
marriages legal, according to the customary personal law of the
contracting parties. Long is the waiting in many cases between
proposal and completion, and many are the disappointments
when the conditions are found to bar completion. Once married,
the husband and wife are made to clearly realise their condition,
and must depart together or not at all.</p>

<p>"The children, of course, are a very serious question, but the
best is done for them,&mdash;their health is so well cared for, that
in Port Blair, probably alone in all the East, it is the rule to
successfully rear the whole of a young family; primary education
is here compulsory, again probably alone in all the East;
and technical training is free to all. Their inheritance of temperament
and their early associations are the points of anxiety
regarding them, but these matters may be fairly said to be
beyond control.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>"The Savings Bank has already been mentioned as a factor
in the education of the convict. How great has been the effect
of this beneficent institution will be seen from the fact that it
was started twenty-seven years ago with 54 accounts, and is
now, and has for years past been, the largest local bank of the
kind in India. It has now over 2300 open convict accounts,
and has had 12,000 accounts opened during its existence. This
means, that for years, more than one fourth of the whole body of
the convicts have kept their savings in it, thus showing how
well they have taken to heart the lessons of thrift and of faith
in the honesty of the Government.</p>

<p>"But far be it from concealing the fact that there is a seamy
side to life in Port Blair. It could not be otherwise; and it
would be easy enough to paint a lurid picture of its inhabitants,&mdash;easy
enough to preach a scathing condemnation of the
envy, hatred, and malice, the uncharitableness, the evil-speaking,
lying and slandering, the murder and the cruel death, of the
amazing immorality, the callous depravity, the downright unabashed
wickedness, that are so constantly forced upon the view.
But such is not to the purpose. Human faults are easily seen
and easily denounced, for such things lie on the surface. The
difficult thing always is to perceive aright the good that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
is in bad men, and bring that out, and that is the object that
the Government is aiming at in the system just explained.</p>

<p>"Any one observing the work of the English in the East may
possibly be struck with the idea that the reason for the
acknowledged capacity of the race for colonial enterprise and
the maintenance of empire is the ability and the willingness
of the average Englishman to put his hand to any kind of
work that may come his way, without any special training,
from framing suitable laws and regulations and creating
suitable organisations to making roads and ditches, building
houses, and clearing land and ploughing it. Here in Port
Blair, the officers entrusted with the creation, organisation, and
maintenance of the Penal Settlement, have, without any special
training for the work, and without any special guidance and
teaching, managed with the worst possible material to work
upon&mdash;life and long-term convicts from every part of India
and Burma&mdash;to create in little more than forty years, upon
primeval forest and swamp, situated in an enervating, and
until mastered, a deadly climate, a community supporting itself
in regard to many of its complicated wants.</p>

<p>"They began with the dense forests, the fetid swamps, and
the pestilential coral banks of tropical islands, and have made
out of them many square miles of grass and arable lands,
supporting over fifty villages besides convict stations. Miles
upon miles of swamp have been reclaimed, the coral banks
have been controlled, and a place with regard to which the
words climate and pestilence were almost synonymous has
been turned into one favourably spoken of as to its healthiness.
The Settlement now grows its own vegetables, tea,<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> coffee,
cocoa, tapioca, and arrowroot; some of its ordinary food grains,
and most of its fodder. It supplies itself with the greater
part of its animal food, and all its fuel and salt. In other lines
of work, it makes its own boats, and provides from its own
resources the bulk of the materials for its buildings, which are
constructed and erected locally. Amongst the materials produced
are all the timber, stone, bricks, lime, and mortar, and
most of the iron and metal work are made up there from raw
material. In the matter of convict clothing, all that is necessary
to be purchased elsewhere are the roughest of cotton hanks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and wool in the first and rawest condition, every other operation
being performed on the spot. It provides much of its own leather.</p>

<p>"In achieving the results, the officers have had first to learn
for themselves as best they could how to turn out the work to
hand, and then to teach what they had learnt to the most
unpromising pupils that can be imagined,&mdash;only about 3 per
cent. of the convicts sent there having been previously employed
on the work required of them in Port Blair. And they have
been hampered all along by the necessities of convict discipline,
by the constant release of their men, and their punishment for
misconduct. It is under such conditions that the Corps of
Artificers and the other convicts have had to be utilised. Nevertheless,
the roads and drains, the buildings and boats, the
embankments and reservoirs, are as good and durable as are
the same class of structures elsewhere. The manufactures are
sufficient for their purpose, and there are among the taught
those who are now skilled in the use of many kinds of machinery.
Cultivation is generally fair, and some of it very good. The
general sanitation&mdash;but here there are peculiar advantages&mdash;is
literally second to none."<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></div>

<p>First of all the industries of the Andamans is that of timber,
and to accelerate and increase it a Steam Tramway has been
instituted, and there are now some 14 miles of line connecting
the forests with the shores of Port Blair. As a further adjunct,
Steam Saw-mills were erected in 1896, and a Forest Department,
that employs 500 to 600 men daily under its own officers, not
only supplies the Settlement with the whole of its requirements
in timber from the local forests, but also exports timber and
forest produce to various places in India and Europe. Of
these latter exports, rattans and gurjan oil are the chief; other
natural products of the islands are trepang&mdash;<i>b&ecirc;che-de-mer</i>&mdash;tortoiseshell
and edible birds' nests, but they are only collected
in small quantities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal cultivations in which convicts and ex-convicts
are engaged are paddy, sugar-cane, Indian corn, and turmeric;
coconuts have during the past thirty-five years been extensively
planted, and besides the agricultural products previously mentioned,
vegetables and fruits of various kinds are grown.</p>

<p>The larger industries in which the penal community is
engaged in have already been alluded to, but there are many
minor employments, the products from which also go towards
making the Settlement self-supporting. Amongst these are
to be found the manufacture of all kinds of furniture, cane chairs,
baskets, many varieties of bamboo-work and ornamental wood-carving,
woven articles, from serviettes to saddle-girths and
blankets, pottery, rope and mats, silver, tin, brass and iron work,
shoemaking, rickshaw and cart building, besides the production
of such materials as lime, bricks, and tiles.</p>

<p>Port Blair is in communication three, and often four times
a month, with Calcutta, Madras, and Rangoon, by the vessels of
the Asiatic Steam Navigation Company. The distances between
the Settlement and the ports named are 796, 780, and 387
miles respectively.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3>THE NICOBAR ISLANDS AND THEIR ABORIGINES</h3>

<p class="pblockquot">The Nicobar Islands and their Aborigines&mdash;The Islands&mdash;Coral Banks&mdash;Nankauri
Harbour&mdash;Population&mdash;Geology&mdash;Earthquakes&mdash;Climate&mdash;Flora&mdash;History&mdash;The
Shom Pe&#7749;: their Derivation, Appearance, Houses,
Gardens, Cooking-vessel, Domestic Animals, Manufactures, Trade,

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">The</span> Nicobars lie 80 miles south of the Andaman group and
110 miles from Sumatra proper, and constitute a chain of
islands 160 miles long, lying in a N.N.W. &frac12; W. direction, with a
branch forking out from their centre N. by E. The area of the
group is about 600 square miles, and it consists of some twenty
islands, of which the principal are, Kar Nicobar, Batti Malv,
Tilanchong, Chaura, Teressa, Bompoka, Kamorta, Trinkat,
Nankauri, Kachal, Little Nicobar, and Great Nicobar.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are several small satellite islands: Great
Nicobar possesses Kondul and Kabra; Little Nicobar, Milo
and Menchal, with Treis, Trak, and Mero&euml; further off; and
lastly, near the south extremity of Tilanchong, there is the
rocky islet named "Isle of Man."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> There are villages on Kondul
and Milo, but Batti Malv and Tilanchong are uninhabited.</p>

<p>Two large isolated coral banks occur&mdash;one near Chaura,
with only 1&frac12; fathoms of water; and another, far more extensive,
in the Sombrero Channel, with 11 fathoms of water above it.</p>

<p>Although the Nicobar Islands are scarcely ever heard of,
the China Mail boats and other great ocean steamers pass
almost in sight of them nearly every day, and they possess in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
the central group one of the finest harbours in the eastern seas.
Nankauri Harbour has not only entrances on the east and west,
that make it practicable for any sort of vessel in both monsoons,
but these are further protected by the islands of Trinkat
and Kachal respectively, which give sheltered anchorage outside
the mouth of the harbour itself.</p>

<p>By any other nation than the British it would be highly
valued at the present time as a coaling station, but, owing to
its proximity to the Straits Settlements, and the failure of the
small islands around to produce anything more valuable than
coconuts, it is completely neglected by its possessors, from both
commercial and strategical standpoints.</p>

<p>The natives of the group number at present a few short
of 6000 (to which should be added a possible 300-400 Shom Pe&#7749;),
and there are generally some 200 foreigners resident in the
north during the trading monsoon. The islands increase in size as
they are passed towards the south, but the contrary is the
case with regard to population, which decreases regularly, island
by island, with one or two exceptions, from Kar Nicobar in
the north with 3451 inhabitants, to Great Nicobar with only 87.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>


<div class="sblockquot">
<p>"The Nicobar Islands belong to an area of elevation which
can be traced from the Bay of Bengal far into the southern
seas,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> and is characterised by two phenomena: first, the activity
of the interior of the earth, showing itself in volcanic action;
and secondly, the activity of the coralline animals, disclosing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
itself in the formation of that kind of coral reefs known as
fringing or coast reefs. The islands occupy a gap without
volcanoes between the volcanic ranges of Sumatra, and Barren
and Narkondam Islands, and the occurrence of young volcanic
rock in them is improbable. They are distinctly characterised
as a portion of the chain of oceanic elevation which began in
former geological periods and still continues, by the upheaved
coral banks, and by the continuous formation of coral reefs. The
synclinals and anticlinals in the geological structure of the islands
are coincident with the direction of the great geological line
of elevation which connects the northern part of Sumatra with
the Andamans.</p>

<p>"Among the geological formations of the Nicobars, three are
the most important:&mdash;(1) An eruptive serpentine, with gabbro
formation. (2) Marine deposits, probably of a younger Tertiary
age, consisting of sandstone, slates, clay marls, and plastic clay.
(3) Recent coral-reef formations.</p>

<p>"The serpentine and gabbro formation is characteristically of
an eruptive nature. The Tertiary sandstones, slates, and clay
marls appear forcibly broken through; their strata is partly
inclined, partly bent in flat, parallel, wave-like undulations. These
rocks are accompanied by coarser and finer breccias, composed
of angular fragments of these same rocks, and they can partly
be regarded as friction breccias, partly as sedimentary tufas, in
which beds of an argillaceous marl are interstratified. The
eruption of these plutonic masses appears therefore to fall
in a time when the formation of the marine deposits was
partially completed, partially still in progress. They broke
through on lines of fracture, of which the principal strike from
S.S.E. to N.N.W. agrees with the longitudinal extension of the
islands. On the middle islands the serpentine and gabbro attain
their greatest development: on Tilanchong, Teressa, Bompoka,
Kamorta, and Nankauri, they form bare hill ranges of 200-500
feet, and their configuration often marvellously resembles that
of younger volcanic formations. The elevatory power has, however,
acted most strongly on the southern islands, and has here
upheaved sandstones and slates to heights of 1500-2000 feet
above sea-level; on the northern islands the same power was, on
the contrary, weakest.</p>

<p>"The clay marls of the northern and central islands (Kar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
Nicobar, Teressa, Bompoka, Kamorta, Trinkat, and Nankauri)
and the sandstones and slates of the southern (Kachal, Little
and Great Nicobar) appear to be only petrologically different
products of one and the same period of deposition. There
are, at the same time, very few materials from which the age
of the marine formation could be determined, as the only fossil
remains which have been found in their strata are fragments
of <i>driftwood</i> changed to brown coal, plants resembling <i>Fucoids,
Foraminifera</i>, and <i>Polycistin&aelig;</i>. All these indicate more or less
distinctly a young Tertiary age.</p>

<p>"We find a repetition of the geological condition of the
Nicobars on the southern coast of Java and the south-west
coast of Sumatra.</p>

<p>"The third principal formation of the Nicobars are coral formations
belonging to the most recent or the present period. Coral
banks of great thickness are found on Kar Nicobar, Bompoka,
Trinkat, and other islands. They consist partly of compact coral
limestone, partly of a coral and shell conglomerate upheaved
30 or 40 feet above the present level of the sea. On all the islands
the original area is to be observed enlarged by coral land which
is only separated by the higher sand-dunes along the shores from
the still continuing formation of the coral reefs surrounding all
the islands in the character of fringing reefs. Although these
raised coral banks are decided evidence of the long-continued
upheaval of the islands&mdash;that, in connection with the eruption of
the serpentines and gabbros&mdash;the formation of the flat coral lands
elevated a few feet only above the sea, can, on the other hand, be
explained by the accumulation of coral fragments, of sand and
shells, by the waves and breakers on the shallow surface of the
fringing reefs."<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Coal of a brown variety has been found in Little Nicobar,
Treis, Milo, and Kondul, but everywhere in isolated masses and
single fragments, showing traces of rolling, met with here and
there without order, in sandstone and slate, and evidently derived
from driftwood.</p>

<p>The only traces of minerals discovered have been ores of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
copper and iron pyrites, finely disseminated through dioritic and
serpentine rocks. The possibility of the occurrence of copper ores
in the eruptive formation cannot be denied, but no discovery has
yet been made which would indicate it. On the other hand, the
islands are rich in useful building materials. The sandstone of
the southern islands must give excellent working stones; the
plastic clays of the north could, doubtless, be worked into bricks
or pottery; the natives of Chaura largely employ it in their
earthenware manufactures.</p>

<p>Although the islands are generally beyond the sphere of
cyclonic disturbances, they have more than once experienced
the effect of earthquakes. One of the most remarkable of these
is said to have occurred from October 31 to December 5, 1847,
when fire is reported to have been seen on one of the mountains
of Great Nicobar. Part of the northern coast of the latter,
especially in the vicinity of Ganges Harbour, sank beneath the
sea, and for long the locality was deserted by the aborigines.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>On December 1881, an earthquake, felt also at the Andamans
and throughout the Bengal Sea generally, caused extensive
damage in Kar Nicobar to the coconut groves and huts of the
natives. Vents were opened in the sandy soil; inland, trees
were overthrown; sea-waves broke on the island, and at the
village of M&#363;s, water rose into the houses of the Burmese traders,
which stood on platforms 2&frac12; feet high.</p>

<p>There was another earthquake at Kar Nicobar in November
1899, when strong, but not alarming, shocks, lasting ten minutes,
were experienced. The last occurred on September 18, 1900,
when two heavy and severe shocks, each lasting five minutes,
were felt throughout the island, but caused no damage.</p>

<p>The climate of the Nicobars is more uniform than that of the
Andamans, for it is less diversified by wet and dry seasons, heat
and cold, and in this respect resembles that of the Malay
Peninsula at the same latitude. The prevalence of malaria
renders the group unhealthy alike for foreigners and, in certain
localities, for the natives, and all the attempts at settlement<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
have resulted in great mortality from this cause, although where
jungle exists an improvement is said to have taken place when
the land has been cleared.</p>

<p>The average mean annual temperature is about 82.5&deg;, the
maximum in the shade between 93&deg; and 94&deg; and the minimum
73&deg;. March and April are the hottest months, with means of 82&deg;
and 83&deg; and a maximum of 89&deg;, while August to December&mdash;when
the mean temperature is 79&deg;&mdash;is the coolest part of the
year. The mean annual temperature at Nankauri is 80&deg;, and
while the highest reading recorded is 99&deg;, the lowest is 70&deg;.
The mean diurnal range there varies between 9&deg; and 11&deg;
only.</p>

<p>Although the seasons of the monsoons are the same, they
are not so well defined among the Nicobars as on the coast of
the Bay of Bengal generally; but heavy rains occur in May,
June and July&mdash;when the south-west monsoon is at its height&mdash;and
rains rarely cease until December. March is the driest
month, and while from May to December there is an average
monthly rainfall of 12 inches, with twenty wet days per month,
for the rest of the year the monthly average is only 2.9 inches,
with showers on twenty-six days only.</p>

<p>At Nankauri the mean humidity is 79 per cent, and the
annual rainfall 110 inches; while, as regards the southern group
of islands, there is good ground for the belief that much more
rain falls, probably not less than an average of 150 inches
annually; this is doubtless attributable to the forest-clad mountains
of Great and Little Nicobar.</p>

<p>The prevailing winds are the monsoons&mdash;the south-west from
the beginning of May till mid-October, followed by variable
winds to the end of the year; the north-east monsoon from
January until April, with an interval of more variable winds
before the other sets in. Hurricanes seldom visit the islands,
but in March 1892 the central group was subjected to a cyclone
which caused much destruction in the forest. During the south-west
monsoon frequent thunderstorms and gales of wind occur,
especially in the vicinity of Great Nicobar.  The north-east<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
monsoon brings fine weather, but sometimes blows with considerable
strength.</p>

<p>A remarkable feature of the Nicobars is the manner in which
the general botanical appearance of the islands coincides with
the geological division, for, while the southern group (Great
and Little Nicobar with Kachal) are wooded from beach to
summit, the forests of the other islands are restricted to the
plutonic rocks and the slopes and dells of the older alluvium,
while the hilly plateaux and ridges are covered with park-like
grass heaths.</p>

<p>The most prominent features of the flora are, perhaps, the
quantities of <i>Barringtonia speciosa</i>, which, with their large shiny
leaves and beautiful crimson-tipped tassel-like blossoms, grow
all along the coasts; the tall screw-pines (<i>Pandanus larum</i>), bearing
the immense fruits that provide the main food of the
natives; and the graceful Nicobar palms (<i>Ptychoraphis augusta</i>),
which occur in all the forests. Giant bamboos are extremely
scarce, but the climbing species (<i>Dinachloa</i>) is common everywhere
in the jungle, and beautiful tree ferns (<i>Alsophila albo-setacea</i>)
grow in the forest and along the river banks of the south.</p>

<p>A mangosteen (<i>Garcinia</i>, sp.) and a cinnamon (<i>Cinnamomum
obtusifolium</i>) grow wild, as do the pepper vine (<i>Piper betel</i>) that
supplies the sireh leaf, and the betel palm (<i>Areca catechu</i>).
These two are also cultivated, and it is said that the latter is
not indigenous.</p>

<p>The large numbers of milky climbers leads to the hope that
some rubber-yielding varieties may be discovered capable of
supplying a sufficient quantity of raw material for export. The
vanilla orchid occurs, and the southern forests produce quantities
of rattan, both as a small variety that is exported, and a large
cane two inches or so in diameter, which the natives use for the
horizontal rafters in the circular framework of their houses.</p>

<p><i>Semecarpus heterophyllus</i>, <i>Morinda citrifolia</i>, <i>Artocarpus
lakoocha</i>, and <i>A. chaplasha</i>, <i>Cordia mixa</i>, <i>Mallotus philipenensis</i>,
and <i>Amomum fenzlii</i>, may be mentioned specially as species
capable of yielding commercial products; but their sparseness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
coupled with the fact that it is easier and cheaper to cover the
soil with coconuts and areca palms, puts out of the question the
possibility of utilising the species to any profit.</p>

<p>The Nicobars produce few trees of any commercial value as
timber, and those probably not in large quantities: the best of
these are <i>Myristica irya</i> and <i>Terminalia bialata</i>, and of secondary
value in this respect are <i>Mimusops littoralis</i>, <i>Hopea odorata</i>,
<i>Artocarpus chaplasha</i> and <i>lakoocha</i>, <i>Calophyllum spectabile</i>, <i>Terminalia
procera</i> and species of <i>Garcinias</i>.</p>

<p>Evergreen forest predominates, and mixed forest appears
only occasionally, but pure leaf-shedding forest is not met with;
and as regards species, there is a marked absence of Dipterocarpus
trees.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>It is in the writings of Ptolemy that we find the first
probable reference to the Nicobars, for after the Andamans, the
next group mentioned by him is the "Barussae," which seems
to be the Lankha <i>B&aacute;l&uacute;s</i> of the older Arab navigators, since
these are certainly the Nicobars.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The islands were also
known to the same voyagers under the names of Megabalu and
Legabalu.</p>

<p>The Chinese, another race of great navigators in these seas,
have records of the Nicobars for a thousand years and more.</p>

<p>The next reference of any importance is that of an Arab trader
who came into contact with the group during a voyage to
Southern China in 851 <small>A.D.</small><a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> "Nagabalus, which are pretty well
peopled: both the men and women there go naked, except that
the women conceal their private parts with leaves of trees.
When shipping is among these islands, the inhabitants come off
in embarkations, and bring with them ambergris and coconuts,
which they truck for iron, for they want no clothing, being free
from the inconveniences of heat or cold."</p>

<p>Rashuddin writes of the islands in nearly the same terms,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
under the name of L&aacute;kv&aacute;rem, opposite Lamuri (a kingdom of
Sumatra), and the very imaginatively-minded author, Friar Oderic,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
compiled a chapter on Nicoveran which is a mass of the wildest
fable, utterly unworthy of credence, containing, as it does, details
of people with faces like dogs, who are stout in battle (not
a characteristic of the modern Nicobarese) and worshippers of
the ox, while their king possessed strings of pearls, and the
largest ruby in the world.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Concerning the island of Necuveran, when you leave the
island of Java the less (Sumatra) and the kingdom of Lambri,
you sail north almost 150 miles and then you come to two islands,
one of which (Great Nicobar) is called Necuveran. In this island
they have no king nor chief, but live like beasts. And I tell
you they all go naked, both men and women, and do not use the
slightest covering of any kind. They are idolaters. Their woods
are all of noble and valuable kinds of trees; such as Red Sanders,
and Indian-nut, and Cloves, and Brazil, and sundry other good
spices. There is nothing else worth relating," says Marco Polo,
who probably only passed near the islands in or about the year
1293, but who gathered fairly accurate information about them.</p></div>

<p>After the Cape of Good Hope was doubled in 1497, the islands
were frequented by voyagers, as expeditions to the East became
more numerous.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"It was the Nicobar custom in 1566," says Master C&aelig;sar
Frederike, that "if any ship come near to that place or coast as
they pass that way, as in my voyage it happened, as I came from
Malacca through the channel of Sombrero, there came two of
their barques near our ship, laden with fruit, as with <i>monces</i> (which
we call Adam's apples, which fruit is like to our turnips, but is very
sweet and good to eat). They would not come into the ship for
anything we could do, neither would they take any money for
their fruit, but they would truck for old shirts or old linen breeches.
These rags we let down with a rope into their barque unto them,
and look what they thought their things to be worth; so much
fruit they would make fast to the rope, and let us hale it in: and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
it was told me that sometimes a man shall have for an old shirt a
good piece of amber."<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p></div>

<p>In his <i>East Africa and Malabar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Barbosa refers shortly to the
Nicobars. "In front of Sumatra, across the Gulf of the Ganges, are
five or six small islands, which have very good water and ports for
ships: they are inhabited by Gentiles, poor people, they are called
Niconbar; and they find in them very good amber, which they
carry thence to Malacca and other ports."</p>

<p>Captain John Davis, of Arctic fame, the inventor of the
"back-staff," the earliest form of quadrant, piloted a Dutch ship
to the East Indies, and touched, in 1599, at the Central Nicobars.
He wrote that "... the people brought in great store of hens,
oranges, lemons, and other fruit, and some ambergris which we
bought for pieces of linen cloth and table napkins. These isles
are pleasant and fruitful, lowland, and have good road for ships.
The people are most base, only living upon fruits and fish, not
manuring the ground, and therefore having no rice."<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Elizabeth, Sir James Lancaster made
several voyages to the East Indies, and touched at the Nicobars.
Two of his officers, Barker and May, have chronicled a visit to
the islands in 1592, in a description that would apply more
accurately to the Pulo Wai group. "The islands of Nicobar,"
says Barker, "we found inhabited with Moors, and after we
came to an anchor, the people came aboard us in their canoes
with hens, cocos, plantains, and other fruits, and in two days
they brought to us royals of plate, giving us them for calicut
cloth, which royals they find by diving for them in the sea, which
were lost not long before by two Portugal ships which were
bound for China and were cast away there. They call in their
language the coco, <i>calambe</i> (Malay, <i>klapa</i>); the plantain, <i>pison</i>
(Mal., <i>pisang</i>); a hen, <i>iam</i> (Mal., <i>ayam</i>); a fish, <i>iccan</i> (Mal., <i>ikan</i>);
and a hog, <i>babi</i> (Mal., <i>babi</i>)"; and May, the other writer, says
that the natives were in religion Mohammedans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>Lancaster's own account of the "Islands of Nicobar" is more
interesting, and is based on his experiences there in 1602. Of
either Pulo Milo or Kondul he writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"Here we had fresh water and some coconuts, other refreshing
had we none. Yet the people came aboard our ships in long
canoes which would hold twenty men in one of them, and brought
gums to sell instead of amber, and therewithal deceived divers of
our men: for these people of the east are wholly given to deceit.
They brought us hens and coconuts to sell, but held them very
dear, so that we bought few of them. We stayed here ten
days....</p>

<p>"We were forced to go to the island of Sombrero (the
Portuguese name for Chaura) some 10 or 12 leagues to the
northward of Little Nicobar. Here we lost an anchor, for the
ground is foul and groweth full of counterfeit coral and some
rocks, which cut our cable asunder.</p>

<p>"The people of these islands go naked, having only the privities
bound up in a piece of linen cloth, which cometh about their
middles like a girdle and so between their twist. They are all
of a tawny colour, and anoint their faces with divers colours:
they are well limbed, but very fearful: for none of them would
come aboard our ships, or enter our boats.</p>

<p>"The General reported that he had seen some of their priests
all apparelled, but close to their bodies, as if they had been
sewed in it; and upon their heads a pair of horns turning
backwards (<i>t&aacute;-ch&ouml;kla</i>), with their faces painted green, black, and
yellow, and their horns also painted the same colour. And
behind them, upon their buttocks, a tail hanging down very
much like in the manner as in some painted clothes we paint
the devil in our country. He demanding wherefore they went
in that attire, answer was made him, that in such form the
devil appeared to them in their sacrifices, and therefore the
priests, his servants, were so apparelled. In this island grow
trees which for their tallness, greatness, and straightness will
serve the biggest ships in all our fleet for a mainmast, and
the island is full of these trees." This description of the island
cannot be said to be applicable at the present day.</p>

<p>"Here likewise we found upon the sand by the seaside a
small twig (<i>Virgularia mirabilis?</i>) growing up to a grand tree,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
and offering to pluck the same, it shrunk down into the ground,
and sinketh unless you hold very hard. And being plucked
up, a great worm is at the root of it: and look how the tree
groweth in greatness the worm diminisheth. Now as soon as
the worm is wholly turned into the tree it rooteth in the
ground, and so groweth to be great. This transformation is
one of the strangest wonders I saw in all my travels. For the
tree being plucked up little, the leaves stripped off, and the
pill by that time it was dry, turned into an hard stone, much
like to white coral; so that the worm was twice transformed
with different natures: of these we gathered and brought home
many."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p></div>

<p>Towards the middle of the century, Koeping, a Swede, touched
at one of the islands in a Dutch vessel and thought he perceived
men with tails, "like those of cats, which they move in
the same manner," but he was deceived by the peculiar clothing.
He further credits the Nicobarese with cannibalism, for a
boat's crew of five men that went ashore never returned, but
next day their bones were found strewn over the beach!<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
Next, Dampier was put ashore by the privateer he piloted on
the N. W. coast of Great Nicobar, and after a short sojourn left
with his companions in a native canoe, and succeeded in reaching
Sumatra.</p>

<p>The first recorded murder of a European by the natives
seems to be that of Captain Owen, who was wrecked on Tilanchong,
and from thence taken to Nankauri, where he was put
to death on account of his ill-judged behaviour towards the
inhabitants. This incident is related by Hamilton in his account
of his own experiences in the East Indies from 1688 to 1723,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>
where he gives a little information about the Nicobars.</p>

<p>The first attempt at a settlement on the islands was made
by Jesuits on Kar Nicobar in 1711, but they succumbed to the
climate, and the effects of such results as they had attained
to soon disappeared. Hitherto no efforts had been made to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
convert the natives, although missionaries of the same denomination
were well acquainted with the group.</p>

<p>In 1756 Tanck took possession of the Archipelago in the
name of Denmark, and under the designation of "Frederiks
Oerne," and founded a colony on the north coast of Great
Nicobar, which in 1760 was transferred to Kamorta, and there
came to an end owing to the unhealthy climate.</p>

<p>In 1766 fourteen Moravians were installed on Nankauri, with
a view to extending the influence of the Danish East India
Company, but in a dozen years nearly every member of the
settlement was dead. They are said to have made no conversions.</p>

<p>A Dane, named Koenig, who was a doctor of the same
religious body, voyaging from India to Siam in 1778, spent
several hours on Kar Nicobar, and in his diary left some account
of his visit; and almost contemporaneously a vessel under the
Austrian flag, the <i>Joseph and Theresa</i>, Captain Bennet, anchored
off the northern island: her voyage was made to obtain plantations
and trading stations in the East for the Austrian Empire.
This was the scheme of a Dutchman, named Bolts, who entered
the Austrian service in 1775, and who accompanied the ship, a
chartered English vessel with an English crew. The expedition
spent five months in the group: a fort was erected on the
island, and ships purchased to trade between Madras, Pegu, and
the Nicobars. War in Europe ruined the company, and it
was suspended after an existence of seven years.</p>

<p>In 1779 two more Moravians settled on Nankauri, in an
attempt to found a fresh Danish Mission, but eight years later
this was abandoned, and the survivor returned to Europe.</p>

<p>With the commencement of the nineteenth century, English
traders from India began to visit the islands for coconuts, and,
through contact with their crews, the custom and life of the
natives seems to have undergone much growth and alteration.</p>

<p>In 1831 Denmark made a last attempt to colonise the group
by missionary enterprise, and Pastor Rosen was sent out. He
dwelt on Nankauri, in the middle of the north side of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
harbour, and for a time also lived on Trinkat; but after three
years he returned to Europe, and some time later published his
experiences.</p>

<p>The year Rosen left, two Catholic missionaries arrived at
Kar Nicobar from Malacca, and lived on Teressa and Kamorta,
but after a time one of them, Borie, died of fever, and the
survivor left. This was the last of the series of missionary
endeavours to found a settlement and convert the inhabitants.</p>

<p>In 1845, Mr Mackay, Danish Consul at Calcutta, chartered
a schooner and made a voyage to the group in search of coal,
which was prospected for without success.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>A year later the Danish corvette <i>Galathea</i>,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> voyaging round
the world, spent some months among the islands, and her
commander, Steen Bille, took possession of the central group
for Denmark, and invested two natives with the insignia of
chief magistrates. Two years afterwards, however, the <i>Valkyrien</i>
was sent to the islands to bring away the flags and b&acirc;tons,
and the last of several ineffective annexations came to an end.
The <i>Galathea</i> expedition surveyed much of the coasts, sought
for coal and other minerals, and named the principal river the
"Galathea."</p>

<p>In 1858 the Austrian frigate <i>Novara</i><a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> spent a month in the
group, during which, half the time was passed at sea. Many
parts hitherto unsurveyed were charted by them, and valuable
knowledge as to the ethnographical and geological conditions
of the islands was obtained.</p>

<p>The islands were finally taken possession of by the Indian
Government in 1869&mdash;the British had officially annexed the
group in 1807, but not occupied it&mdash;and a settlement was formed
at Nankauri Harbour to check the piratical proceedings of that
place, and although this was given up in 1888, after it had served
its purpose, the history of the Nicobars is now bound up with that
of the Andamans, to which they are affiliated.</p>

<p>Although the inhabitants of the Nicobar Islands were originally
all of the same stock, various causes have contributed to
bring about a distinction amongst them, and they are now
separated into two distinct ethnical groups,&mdash;the Shom Pe&#7749; of
the interior of Great Nicobar, and the coast people, or Nicobarese,
who are found in all the inhabited islands.</p>

<p>Of the Shom Pe&#7749; but little is known, as, with the exception
of a few families who have friendly intercourse with the coast
villages, they have, as now constituted, always been persistently
hostile to the Nicobarese, but it is probable that they number at
most between 300 and 400 individuals.</p>

<p>It was for long believed that the interior of Great Nicobar
was inhabited by a race of Negritoes akin to the Andamanese,
but the Shom Pe&#7749; are an isolated group of primitive Malayans,
and although they must be regarded as the aborigines of the
islands, many features amongst them point to the fact that they
are no longer racially pure.</p>

<p>Not only does the facial appearance vary greatly, but the hair,
which is universally regarded as an almost infallible indication of
race amongst primitive peoples, occurs in all the grades between
curly and straight.</p>

<p>To account for this latter difference, and for the dull brown
colour of the skin&mdash;far darker than is usual amongst Malays&mdash;one
may of course suggest remote Negrito admixture. Possibly the
Andamanese, on one of the predatory voyages which it seems they
were not unaccustomed to make in this direction,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> may have
reached the island, and for some reason unable to return, have
intermixed with the inhabitants.</p>

<p>But I think it more probable that these peculiarities are due
to a Dravidian strain, and that some mariners of this race, who,
from before the time of Solomon, were accustomed to make
trading voyages to the Eastern Archipelago,<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> became stranded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on these islands, and incorporated themselves with the people
they found there.</p>

<p>In this way, not only would the nature of the hair, colour of
the skin, and occasional definiteness of feature, be accounted for,
but the aborigines would be left as we now find them, unreduced
in height, while mixture with the Andamanese would probably
have the effect of lessening their stature.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have, since my acquaintance with these people,
occasionally met Tamils, whom, if I had seen similarly garbed in
the forests of Great Nicobar, I believe I should have been unable
to distinguish from Shom Pe&#7749;.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, they much resemble, in appearance and
mode of life, descriptions of many of the primitive Malayans who
have intermixed with Negritoes. Of these the Kubus of Sumatra
are an instance,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> and of the Jakuns of Johore, who are believed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
be of Negrito origin, but much interbred with Malays. Mr H.
Lake<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> writes: "The true Jakun is of short stature, 5 feet 2 inches
is a fair average height. They are much darker in colour than
the Malay, and, as a rule, not so well set up. The hair, which
in the pure Negrito curls closely, is here in most cases simply
wavy, or even straight. They live in small communities, and
subsist miserably on fruits, roots, etc. They seldom remain many
weeks in the same spot, but wander from place to place, living
under scanty shelters built on rickety poles at a considerable
height from the ground. It is not uncommon to find a dozen
in company, with a tame monkey or two, cats and dogs, living
in perfect harmony under the same roof."</p>

<p>We may therefore consider the Shom Pe&#7749; to be the aborigines
of the group, who, although everywhere else either exterminated
or absorbed by settlers from outside, have in Great Nicobar
found a refuge in the forest depths, and by long-standing hostility
to the intruders, arising from some unknown cause, have preserved
to a great extent their natural traits and existence, although
somewhat degenerated, both on account of the less favourable
circumstances in which they live and of the interbreeding that
the smallness of their numbers compels.</p>

<p>Although the Shom Pe&#7749; are by measurement as tall in the
average as the coast people, to the eye they appear smaller, and
they are less robust, with lean though bony figures (average
chest measurements, 35.2 inches), sinewy rather than muscular.</p>

<p>Fourteen measurements of adult males gave a maximum
height of 67&frac34; inches, a minimum of 62&#8539; inches, and an average
height of 64 inches. Of eight women measured, the tallest was
65&frac14; inches in height, and the smallest 57&#8540; inches, while the
average stature of that number was found to be 60.8 inches.</p>

<p>The colour of the skin is a dark muddy-brown or bronze
(several shades deeper than the coast natives), but it is liable
to slight variation, and is generally a little paler in the women
and girls, who resemble far more distinctly the coarse Malayan
type than the men do.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>The hair of the head is very luxuriant, and of all varieties
between wavy and curly, but is not crisp or frizzly to any degree.
No hair grows on the face, or on the body, save about the armpits,
etc.</p>

<p>The outline of the face is an oblong rectangle, and the forehead
is somewhat retreating, but occasionally high and rounded,
though narrow; the supraciliary arch is prominent, but the eyebrows
are light. The eyes, with black pupils, are both oblique
and horizontal, and when the latter, are often accompanied by
the Mongolian fold, which occurs most frequently among the
women.</p>

<p>The nose is broad and flattened, with rounded tip and rather
rounded nostrils, the plane of which is upward. It is generally
of medium size and straight, but now and again has a pronounced
bridge, or a slightly concave outline.</p>

<p>The cheekbones and zygomatic arch are prominent, and a
degree of prognathism is prevalent. The teeth are large, irregular,
and discoloured, and project outwards. The mouth is large, the
lips thick, with the upper very curved from centre to ends; they
are generally closed. The lower jaw is commonly large and
heavy, and the chin is pointed, as the bones converge directly
from the basal angle. The ears lie close to the head, and are
hidden by the hair, but the lobes are much distorted with plugs
of wood.</p>

<p>The huts in which the Shom Pe&#7749; dwell, although always
built on piles, show considerable differences, and vary from a
well-built floor with a carefully constructed roof of palm leaf
attap, to a rough platform often placed against the side of a tree
and sheltered by two or three palm branches fastened to the
corners.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

</div>

<p>They are said to possess gardens enclosed in zigzag fences,
where they cultivate bananas, yams, and other tubers. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
pandanus fruit they cook in a well-made vessel of sheets of bark,
carefully protected with green leaves and luted with clay, in
which we can, perhaps, see one of the origins of pottery; for
it is quite admissible that, in course of time, the leaves should
be discarded, more clay added, and at length the effect of fire on
the latter having been observed, the bark also would be done
away with, or only used as a mould for a clay vessel, from which
more suitable shapes would finally be evolved.</p>

<p>The domestic animals are dogs, cats, chickens, and pigs,
which are generally caught when young in the jungle, and
apparently not permitted to attain any respectable size. All
find a refuge in the houses, up to which a sort of inclined plane
is arranged for their convenience.</p>

<p>Their manufactures are very few. They make canoes;
construct a spear out of a single piece of wood, baskets,
both of rattan and palm spathe, and a rough cloth from the
inner bark of a tree.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>The friendly Shom Pe&#7749; are energetic collectors of rattan,
which they trade with the Nicobarese, and so obtain garments,
beads, knives, <i>parangs</i>, axes, and tobacco, which is smoked in
the form of cigarettes. They are great consumers of betel-nut,
in combination with lime and sireh.</p>

<p>Amongst these friendly families, the clothing worn is similar
to that of the Nicobarese, with necklaces of beads, and they
employ a large wooden ear-distender an inch and a half in
diameter.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The sheets of bark cloth are used as pillows and
coverings at night, and amongst the hostile aborigines it is
said the women wear short petticoats of this material, while the
men go entirely clothesless.</p>

<p>Amongst those met with, there was generally one man in
each party, who, by virtue possibly of superior intelligence or
knowledge of the coast language, seemed to have some slight
authority over the remainder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>They are monogamous, and, unlike the Nicobarese, marry
for life. The position of the women is apparently a satisfactory
one, for they are regarded as little or in no way inferior to
the men. The men obtain the food, the women prepare it.
Rattans are collected in the jungle by the men, and by them
carried to market; both sexes together prepare it, by scraping
and splitting, for sale. When bringing articles for barter, the
men bore the spears, and the baskets and cloth were carried
by the women, and generally such things as were obtained in
exchange were immediately handed over to the latter.</p>

<p>All those met with seemed quiet, stolid, and timid in disposition;
but a cupidity for the goods of their neighbours at
times overcomes the latter characteristic amongst the less
accessible of the aborigines, and many are the murderous
attacks they are said to have made on the Nicobarese for the
purpose of loot.</p>

<p>No infants or young children were seen, although surprise
visits were paid to several of the villages, neither were any
old people <i>en evidence</i>, but the ages were judged to vary between
ten and forty-five years.</p>

<p>The language differs from all others in the islands, but here
and there are individuals who know sufficient of the coast
speech to hold converse with the Nicobarese.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Their carelessness with regard to their water-supply&mdash;for
any muddy pool or stagnant brook is made use of&mdash;is probably
sufficient reason for the large number of cases of elephantiasis
occurring among them; the only other affection besides this,
that seems to be in anyway chronic, is the common body ringworm
of the tropics.</p>

Archipelago, we may suppose that not all, but most, of the
islands were occupied by groups of the aborigines, who every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>where
but in Great Nicobar&mdash;where, because of its size and
forest-clad nature they could find a refuge&mdash;became either
exterminated or absorbed by successive arrivals of colonists
that have since made the presence of the former almost indistinguishable.</p>

<p>In spite of the partial likeness of type, it is doubtful whether
all, or nearly all, the islands were occupied by the aborigines.
Tilanchong, for instance, is uninhabited, and it is questionable
whether such forestless islands as Kar Nicobar, Chaura, or
Kamorta, etc., could be suitable habitats for such a primitive
people. In Kachal, Nankauri, and Little Nicobar we have
islands of a similar character to Great Nicobar, although in them
no traces of a rude people are to be found. It is probably on
account of the smallness of these areas that the immigrants
succeeded in eradicating the first inhabitants, who, in the other
island alone, hostile causes notwithstanding,<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> have preserved for
themselves a separate existence.</p>

<p>To account for such features as are common to both peoples
everywhere, we may conclude, therefore, that while many of
the latter aborigines survived separately, the others were
absorbed by settlers on the coasts, who, by communication
and intermarriage with islands not possessing an indigenous
element, carried the Shom Pe&#7749; strain throughout the Archipelago.</p>

<p>The arrival of numerous colonists from the eastward would
account for the lighter complexion of the Nicobarese; for it is
only natural to suppose that if a separate branch of the same
people, the one living in the open on the coast would be
darker in complexion than the other, instead of which the
contrary is the case.</p>

<p>As to the component parts of the Nicobarese, various suggestions
have been made. They are Malays modified by a Burmese
element;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> the descendants of Malays before Mahommedanism
spread among them (close of thirteenth century), but separated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
at a much earlier date;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> or, again, they are of the same race
as the Battaks.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>They are described as offshoots of the Malay race, being a
people which, while possessing much in common with the Indo-Chinese
stock, nevertheless, in their physical characteristics, hold
a place midway between the Malays and the Burmese.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>It has also been said of them that they are "descended from
a mongrel Malay stock, the crosses being probably in the
majority of cases with the Burmese, and occasionally with natives
of the opposite coast of Siam, and perchance also in remote
times with such of the Shom Pe&#7749; as may have settled in their
midst."<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The natives of Teressa are probably not greatly wrong
when they say that the inhabitants of Nankauri are Malays, who
when out fishing lost their boats and settled there, and the
Kar Nicobarese are descendants of the Burmese who, in a
revolution that took place in their country, were obliged to
leave the Tenasserim coast.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>In the first case, it is not difficult to admit that fishing-boats
belonging to Sumatra (90 miles distant), or to the Malay
Peninsula (260 miles away), should be blown off-shore in a
storm, and safely reaching Nankauri yet not care to face the
voyage back.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p>Pegu is about 400 miles from the islands, and Tenasserim a
little less. About 1000 <small>A.D.</small> the first historical conquest of the
Lower Irrawadi was effected by the Burmese, and its inhabitants,
the Mous, became known as "Talaings," or slaves. Their final
defeat took place in 1757.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing is more possible than that, after one of their
disasters, a small section of the Talaings fled from their home
and established themselves in the Nicobars, which they had probably
become cognisant of in the way of trade.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> At present
the only sea-going craft are a few score "kallu," small junks of
20-60 tons, built in Tavoy, which, manned by five or six
Talaings, venture as far as the Nicobars, where they ship coconuts
in the fine monsoon.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Nor are these all, for the islanders are doubtless leavened by
stray immigrants from India,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>&mdash;which would account for the not
infrequent occurrence of Caucasian features among them,&mdash;by
Arabs, and even by Chinese.</p>

<p>Malays and Burmese&mdash;or rather Talaings&mdash;formed, however,
the greater part of the intrusive element.</p>

<p>Although colonisation was very local&mdash;the reason possibly
for so many distinct languages in the group&mdash;the islands now
exhibit a state of transition, due to intercrossing. Individuals
occur at the extremes of the Archipelago who bear a striking
resemblance to each other, but nevertheless there is a marked,
though vague, difference to be seen when the natives of several
of the islands, or groups of islands, are compared with each
other as a body.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"All things considered, it may be inferred that the Archipelago
was originally occupied by primitive peoples of Malayan
stock, now represented by the Shom Pe&#7749; of Great Nicobar, and
was afterwards resettled on the coast-lands by Indo-Chinese and
Malayan intruders, who intermingled, and either extirpated and
absorbed, or else drove to the interior, the first occupants."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></div>

<p>It is difficult to picture a typical representative of this much-mixed
people, as even in those islands that have a distinct
speech of their own, and whose inhabitants might be supposed
to be fairly homogenous, wide differences are met with, as above
pointed out. The variations, however, are not sufficient on the
whole to merit separate descriptions of the inhabitants of each
island.</p>

<p>These variations occurring in size, features, and hair, show that
the Nicobarese are a thoroughly mixed race, for the points do not
coincide with each other; that is to say, curly hair does not always
go with a prominent nose, or straight hair with Malayan features.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to describe a representative specimen
who combines all the prominent prevalent characteristics, but
they seem capable of division into two classes, the smaller of
which is superior in appearance to the other, and is often
strikingly Caucasian, with oval face, straight eyes, aquiline nose,
and thin lips.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>The result of about forty measurements shows that the
maximum height of an adult male Nicobarese is 70&frac34; inches;
the minimum, 59&frac14; inches; and the average stature, 63.9 inches.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
While thus somewhat under middle height, they are well built
(average chest measurement, 35.3 inches) and proportioned,
muscular, and on the whole a sturdy-looking race.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>The colour of the skin is a brown much resembling in colour
the tint of a sun-burnt, weather-beaten Malay, such as a sailor; it
is darker than the ordinary native of that race, and has less of the
olive or yellow about it.</p>

<p>The hair is of a rusty black, but generally glossy with oil: it
is thick and luxuriant, and reaches to the shoulders, varying
between a slight waviness and pronounced curls. It is somewhat
coarse, and when kept short with boys, is almost bristly, and
stands up stiffly all over the head. In about 5 per cent. of the
men there are traces of moustache and beard, otherwise the
faces are smooth, but the axill&aelig; and elsewhere, and often legs
and thighs, are profusely covered with hair.</p>

<p>The form of skull is brachycephalic, with an index of about
80.5, and the back of the head, among the natives of the central
and southern groups of islands (excepting the Shom Pe&#7749;), is noticeably
flat.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
The face is broad, and, but for the cheek-bones,
which are generally prominent and developed laterally, approaches
the oval type. Often, however, it has a somewhat rectangular
outline, owing to the squareness of the lower jaw in the rear.
The features are somewhat flat. The forehead is slightly rounded
and even well-formed, but it is often compressed at the temples,
and falls away somewhat suddenly.</p>

<p>The supraciliary arch is prominent, and the eyebrows are
generally fixed in a permanent scowl; the pupil is black, and the
eyes often&mdash;though not as a rule&mdash;slightly oblique, with the
Mongolian fold at the corner.</p>

</div>

<p>The nose is generally broad, and coarse in outline, is straight,
and of medium length, depressed at the bridge, flattened, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
rounded tip, has inflated <i>alae nasi</i>, and the plane of the nostrils
directed upward.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>There is often marked prognathism of the dental variety, and
the teeth are irregular and blackened, large and projecting&mdash;frequently
growing outwards at an angle, like those of a rabbit.</p>

<p>The mouth is naturally large, and its shape is not improved
by holding the betel-quid between the upper lip and teeth. The
lips are moderately thick, and the lower is often pendulous and
turned down, showing much of the mucous membrane. When
at rest, the lips are kept apart.</p>

<p>The chin is usually rather retreating, small, with a rounded
and pointed tip; but the jaw is somewhat heavily hung at the
base, and the posterior angle is strongly marked.</p>

<p>The ears are well formed, moderately large, and lie close to
the head, unless drawn out of shape by much use of ear-distenders.</p>

<p>The Nicobarese have not always been given a good character
by their acquaintances. They have been called lazy, inactive,
and drunken, cowardly and treacherous, but this last must be
taken as applying more to those bands of pirates&mdash;with a probable
large foreign element&mdash;who committed so many crimes during
a long period; otherwise, they are harmless and good-tempered.
The accusation of cowardice is made with more truth, and it is
a quality they frankly own up to.</p>

<p>Lazy and inactive they may be from our point of view, but
hardly otherwise. Food is abundant all round them, weapons
are not necessary, and clothing they do not really need. They
show plenty of application and care when making their canoes,
building their houses&mdash;which in construction are models of neatness&mdash;and
in gathering the toddy, that with betel-nut is, perhaps,
their only native luxury. Drunken they certainly are on many
occasions, but the state with them is one that, fortunately, does
not give rise to troublesomeness.</p>

<p>They are honest in their commercial transactions, and are
most indignant should their integrity be impugned, while the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
accusation of untruthfulness brings them up in arms immediately.</p>

<p>Somewhat absent in manner, unemotional and apathetic, the
more intelligent are yet extremely inquisitive towards strangers,
and ask endless questions of a personal kind.</p>

<p>Although not remarkable for courtesy, or possessing any
forms of salutation,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> they are very hospitable, and always ready
with coconuts, cigarettes, etc., for a visitor. It is customary for
natives, when travelling, to enter without remark any house on
their path, help themselves to food and drink, and depart in
silence.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>They are exceedingly independent in manner and spirit, are
of a somewhat commercial turn of mind, and are occasionally
gifted with a distressing importunity, which is most common in
those places where visits from Europeans have been most frequent.</p>

<p>Parents seem to possess great affection for their infants, and
the number of men, especially, who may be seen about the
villages carrying their children, or otherwise amusing them, is
remarkable.</p>

<p>Six distinct dialects and languages are spoken in the Archipelago&mdash;one
on Kar Nicobar, another on Chaura; Teressa and
Bompoka together have one; the central islands of Kamorta,
Nankauri, Trinkat, and Kachal speak a fourth; while Little and
Great Nicobar with their adjacent islands have a fifth. Lastly,
the Shom Pe&#7749; of the interior of Great Nicobar employ a speech
that is dissimilar to the others.</p>

<p>The language, which is somewhat harsh in sound, has, however,
"an extraordinarily rich, phonetic system&mdash;as many as twenty-five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
consonantal and thirty-five vowel sounds (it possesses a peculiar
double series of nasal vowels)&mdash;is polysyllabic, and untoned, like
the Malayo-Polynesian, and the type seems to resemble the
Oceanic more than the Continental Mongol subdivision."<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>This is the theory of the Kar Nicobarese with regard to their
origin:&mdash;</p>

<p>A certain man, from some unknown country, arrived at the
Nicobars on a flat, with a pet female dog, and settled in Kar
Nicobar. In course of time he espoused the bitch, and begot a
son. When this son was grown up, he concealed his mother by
covering her with a <i>ngong</i>, a kind of petticoat made of coco-palm
leaves, and, after killing his father in the jungle, took his mother
to wife. From such parents the Nicobarese believe they originated,
and it is their progeny who now people the island.</p>

<p>The two-horned head-dress&mdash;<i>t&aacute;-ch&ouml;kla</i>&mdash;worn by all males,
they consider symbolic of their mother's ears; the end of the
loin-cloth that dangles behind, they call her tail; and the piece
of cotton reaching to the women's knees only, they compare
with the <i>ngong</i> petticoat, which was her first dress.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recently, this <i>ngong</i>&mdash;a thick fringe of
palm leaf about 15 inches deep, inserted in a band&mdash;was in
universal wear (see Koeping, Hamilton, Lancaster, and others)
and, even now, it is worn sometimes by the women when working
in the plantations. It is also worn at Teressa, and still more
at Chaura.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Another version of the legend varies somewhat, making the
father a dog and the mother a woman. It is owing to this
belief that the natives say they are sons of a dog, and for this
reason they treat their dogs very kindly, and never beat them:
they quiet them by simply saying "Hush! hush!"</p>

<p>There is another tradition amongst the Nicobarese, to the
effect that the first stranger who came to their islands, seeing
something moving on the sand, perceived small people the size of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
an ant. He took care of them until they attained the common
size of men&mdash;and this was the origin of the natives.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>To account for the coconut trees that grow in such abundance
on the island, the Kar Nicobarese version runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a scarcity of water, and a certain
man then produced it from his elbow by means of magic arts.
The people therefore considered him to be a devil-man&mdash;wizard&mdash;and
beheaded him. On the spot where the head fell there
sprang up a tree, and after a time it became very big, and
began to bear fruit, and the fruit resembled the head of the
slain man.</p>

<p>For a long time the people were afraid to approach the
tree or to taste the nuts, because they had grown out of a
human head, and so, by the falling of the ripe fruit, there grew
up a dense grove of coconut palms.</p>

<p>At last some wise men brought to the trees an old man
who was dying, and made him taste of the nuts, to find out
their qualities! The old man accordingly ate one, and found it to
be very delicious, and from continually eating nuts he became
very strong, and grew to look like a young man.</p>

<p>Thenceforth the people began to make use of the coconut!</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>In the old days it was the custom to kill men for any
offence, grave or simple. But at length the elders, finding that
the population had greatly diminished thereby, held a council,
and introduced the system of killing pigs, burning houses, felling
trees, breaking canoes, and destroying clothes, etc., and this method
is continued at the present day side by side with the former.</p>

<p>The people seldom have open fighting among themselves,
neither do they use their fists, or flog. In extreme cases only
(witchcraft) do they commit murder.</p>

<p>The Nicobarese have no conception of a Supreme Being,
or a future state, but there is a universal belief in evil spirits,
who are in part ghosts of the wicked, and who can be propitiated
by offerings and kept away by exorcisms.</p>

<p>These creations of the imagination, who in the northern
island are called <i>S&iacute;yas</i>, seem much akin to the <i>N&aacute;ts</i> of Indo-China,
but are far less localised, and, as a rule, have no particular
tree, rock, or stream for their abode. They are the cause of
every misfortune and disease that occurs to man, but death in
the ordinary course of things is considered to be a natural
event.</p>

<p>It would appear that in Kar Nicobar, Teressa, and Chaura,
where the superstitious practices are nearly alike, some idea
is entertained of spirits not altogether inimical to mankind;
but in the other islands, whose beliefs are all homogenous, the
<i>Iwis</i> are all harmful to human beings, and are kept at a distance
by a redundancy of charms and talismans that does not occur
in the north.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The latter, which include various objects, such as figures of
men, women, animals, etc., pictures, banners, and so on, are
none of them regarded as idols or worshipped, neither are they
fetishes&mdash;the instruments of spirits, or themselves endowed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
life&mdash;although those of them representative of living objects
are from time to time given such food as pork or coconuts.
They merely act as "scare-devils," putting to flight the demons
of sickness and guarding their constructors from any misfortune.
They are effective only on behalf of those who make them, and
at such person's death it is the custom to destroy or discard the
talismans.</p>

<p>The natives have no temples or any form of worship, but
there have come into being <i>shamans</i> or priest-doctors, known
as <i>tamiluanas</i> and <i>menluanas</i>, who have the power of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>municating
with the spirits, and by means of certain ceremonies,
in conjunction with the use of rods, particular leaves, and ashes,
periodically, by open warfare and by magic, drive the malignant
demons from such places in man's neighbourhood as they may
have intruded into, or defeat them when prevailing disease or
misfortune can be traced to their agency.</p>

<p>These practices and beliefs, which it would be incorrect
to class together under the name of religion, are not accompanied
by any moral element. Their code of ethics has no
connection whatever with the form of malevolent spiritualism
which they entertain, but is entirely an affair of public opinion
and social convention.</p>

<p>The cult of the natives as it exists in the south, with its
multiplicity of charms, "medicine," and demon-scaring figures
and objects, is probably only an isolated case of a practice
widely spread throughout the Malayan Archipelago&mdash;in Sumatra,
Borneo, and other islands, and even amongst the Papuans still
further east.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it is not at all impossible, in view of
the natives' acquisitiveness of foreign ideas, that most of their
practices arise from a corrupted interpretation of the, in other
respects, futile teachings of the numerous missionaries who
have laboured in vain in the islands, complicated by an additional
jumble of tenets adopted from other strangers with whom
they have come into contact, while, in particular, the figures,
pictures, and charms of many localities may be to some extent
merely a degraded survival of the religious paraphernalia of
the Jesuit missionaries.</p>

<p>One might adduce in support of this theory the fact that
superstition and its accessories thrive most strongly in the
places where the missionaries as a rule establish themselves&mdash;Kar
Nicobar and Nankauri Harbour.</p>

<p>Fever, colic, coughs, rheumatism, and sore and inflamed
eyes, are not unfrequent ailments. Syphilis also occurs, and
has probably been introduced by the traders, or by the
Nicobarese who have visited Calcutta and Moulmein in their
vessels.</p>

<p>Itch (<i>tinea circinata tropica</i>) is in some localities very
prevalent among the natives, who are also liable to attacks of
a mild form of elephantiasis throughout the Archipelago. It is
said that in Chaura from one-third to one-half the population
are so diseased in one way or the other. Cases of yaws occur
from time to time among children.</p>

<p>Eno's fruit salt, camphor, castor-oil, turpentine, and quinine,
are the principal features of the Nicobarese pharmacop&#339;ia.</p>

<p>Eno's fruit salt mixed with water, with a little powdered
camphor and turpentine added, is given twice a day for colic.
For fever, a little quinine is added to the same mixture.</p>

<p>Sandalwood and jessamine oil are held in great repute as
aphrodisiacs, and are purchased from the Burmese traders in
small quantities at a very high price.</p>

<p>Faith, however, is not always placed in the efficacy of
mundane remedies. A woman who had been ill for a year,
when asked if she would take medicine, replied, "The devil has
caused this illness, and it cannot be cured by medicine. Only
the <i>tamiluanas</i> can cure me by driving the devil out of me."
She preferred sugar and biscuits to drugs.</p>

<p>Malaria, which is perhaps the indisposition by which they
are most frequently attacked, is always attributed to demonic
agency.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Marriage amongst the Nicobarese is of a class that is considered
to be a modification of the matriarchal system, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
that exists widely spread in this portion of the world amongst
the Malayan and Indo-Chinese peoples.</p>

<p>Until he marries, a man considers himself a member of his
father's household, but after that event he calls himself the son
of his father-in-law, and becomes a member of his wife's family,
leaving the house of his own parents, or even his village, if the
woman dwell elsewhere.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p>Only the chiefs, or wealthy men whose positions in the
village are of influence, are exceptions to this law; they are
permitted by custom to bring their wives to their own houses.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>There is no law of exogamy amongst them&mdash;a man marries
in his own village, village-group, or even house; for although
connections between blood relatives are disapproved of, there is
nothing to prevent such taking place, except public opinion, which
may often be disregarded with impunity.</p>

<p>The woman on her marriage brings no special dower into
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>the partnership, neither is there any custom by which the man
is compelled to place a certain amount of property at the
disposal of her parents. Each has a right to a certain proportion
of their common household possessions, and their worldly status
improves by inheritance and by their own efforts.</p>

<p>Those marriages are most successful from which children
are numerous, for these make life easier by taking a large
amount of the daily and special work upon themselves, and
by acting as a support and provision to their parents in
old age.</p>

<p>There is very little that is binding in the marriage state of
these people, cohabitation with its duties being co-existent with
mutual consent. So long as they like each other and are contented
with their position, the couple remain together; but the
absence of children, illness, old age, and many extremely
trivial reasons are sufficient cause for separation.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> The
divorce is a matter for the two most concerned only; there
are no public proceedings to take place, no ceremonies to
undergo.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Most of the adult members of the population have been
married three or four times, a goodly number far more often.
The children of the partnership, if young, go with the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
influential of the parents; when older, they exercise an individual
choice.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>From the nature of the marriage, the woman as often divorces
her husband as <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>

<p>The natives as a race are monogamous, but now and again
polygamy is found to occur. It is practised, however, only by
the chiefs and more wealthy men, who live in their own houses,
and can afford to domicile their wives in separate dwellings.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Cases of adultery are punished by a fine, but there is no
established amount. The village elders consult together as to
what the seducer shall be mulcted of, and generally decide on a
certain number of pigs, which are cut up and distributed among
the community.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>There seems to be no objection to a girl having as many
lovers as she likes before marriage, and altogether the state when
entered upon is one that presses very lightly on the people.
There are few unwritten laws on the subject, and public opinion
is of hardly any weight.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Courtship, like marriage, is merely a variation of the Malayan
custom of nocturnal visiting, much simplified, however, by the
absence of any ceremonies to mark its change into a more stable
relationship.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>When a man desires to marry a girl, he contracts a friendship<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
with her family, assists her in her daily work, and sleeps for a
time in whatever house she may occupy. During the night he
seeks the girl, who will be sleeping among others, and by blowing
on the burning end of a cigarette he obtains light enough to discriminate.
The efforts of the man to embrace and caress her the
girl withstands vigorously with blows and scratches, so that his
face and chest are often torn and covered with blood. So things
continue for several nights perhaps, the man suffering patiently
the while, until, if she is willing to take him as a husband, she
yields herself. This is their nuptials, and concludes the marriage.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Thenceforth, the man holds to his wife's house rather than his own
family's, but often the parents will learn nothing for some time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the girl makes the path of courtship less easy, by
changing her sleeping-hut from night to night. This difficulty
the lover generally overcomes by employing small boys to follow
her about and inform him of her resting-place.</p>

<p>Occasionally the man, following the girl home at night after a
dance, etc., will meet with an attempt at resistance on the part of
the other women dwelling there, when he essays to enter the house
she has chosen.<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p></div>

<p>A man wishing to escape the consequences of marriage, and
thinking he was unrecognised in the darkness by others during
his intercourse with the girl, will nearly always be identified by
some of the women present. If he refuses to carry out his share
of the contract, a council is called of the principal men of his
village, and they fine him so many pigs, which form the material
for a general feast.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>In the northern islands, the "Town Halls" in the <i>Elpanams</i>
are the property of the community in general, for they are the
work of the whole village. The products of the forest are common
to all, but it is now necessary to obtain the headman's permission
before occupying a piece of land near the village, to build a house
or make a garden on.</p>

<p>Everything which the village as a whole makes or purchases,
as the <i>Elpanam</i> houses or Chaura canoes, is common property,
but the result of individual work belongs to the individual.
Plantations, coconuts,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> canoes, and houses, are private possessions,
liable, however, to family claims founded on common family work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Both sexes inherit, and property is generally divided equally
among the heirs.</p>

<p>There is in Kar Nicobar a method of guarding property
termed <i>takoia</i>, which at first is liable to be taken for a case of
<i>tabu</i> or <i>pomali</i>. Posts and sticks, decorated with coloured rags
and coconut husks, are erected near gardens, plantations, etc.
They have no superstitious significance whatever, and only act
as a kind of notice of title, warning all and sundry that the
surroundings are private property. Anyone discovered stealing
the same is fined, <i>i.e.</i>, the usual pigs are confiscated to feast the
community.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>The village headman and his deputy are a recent institution
of the authorities to simplify the procedure of controlling the
natives. The opinion of the village is generally taken on the
question, and, if approved of, their nominees are invested with
a certificate, a flag, and a suit of clothes, presented yearly.</p>

<p>The headmen can command no obedience, and enforce no
laws; they work only by persuasion; and, with the more influential
men, deliberate on vexed questions, and impose fines, which seem
always paid. Such fines do not accrue to the benefit of the
injured party, but of the community, who enjoy a feast as the
result, in which the culprit himself takes part.</p>

<p>As the headman now stands, he is the successor of the village
"captain" or presiding elder, who had no other functions but to
represent the community on the arrival of ships, and to regulate
barter. His office and title were instituted by the natives when
relations with European vessels became frequent, in order that
they might have some representative to correspond to the
commanding officer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>Before this epoch, everybody seems to have been on a footing
of complete social equality, as, with the exceptions above-noted,
is the case to-day.</p>

<p>Everyone, even children, is his own master; but persons who
have been abroad, by virtue of their experience, are respected and
have some authority, as also have the aged and wealthy. But
there is no one who has power to exercise control over even a
single village, save in the way of carrying out popular ideas.</p>

<p>A "primitive form of socialism exists. Chiefs are unknown.
Certain individuals, by force of character ... have more influence
than others ... but this influence seems to be at best but slight,
and each person is obedient to himself alone, or to some unwritten
code of public opinion"<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>&mdash;really the essence of the whole system.</p>

<p>The position of women is, and always has been, in no way
inferior to that of the other sex. They take their full share in the
formation of public opinion, discuss publicly with the men matters
of general interest to the village, and their opinions receive due
attention before a decision is arrived at. In fact, they are consulted
on every matter, and the henpecked husband is of no
extraordinary rarity in the Nicobars.</p>

<p>In Kar Nicobar, where the villages are divided into groups
of several houses, a woman occasionally succeeds her late
husband as sub-chief, on account of the knowledge she may
possess of the regulations in vogue, the property and customs
of her neighbours.</p>

<p>Women take a fair share in the day's work. They do the
cooking, and the whole family eats together; the men build
the houses, canoes, etc.; both sexes may be seen working in
company in the plantations, fishing on the reefs, and paddling
the canoes.</p>

<p>It is only the women in Chaura who manufacture pottery;
but as the art is a monopoly, they must be looked on as rather
privileged than otherwise.</p>

<p>In fine, there is no actual division of labour, but all assist
in whatever has to be done, from their earliest years. Although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
scarcely any obedience seems due from children to their parents,
most of the ordinary tasks of life are undertaken by young
people of both sexes, and much deference is paid to age,
especially when it is combined with wealth.</p>

<p>The domestic animals of the Nicobarese are swine, cats,
fowls, and dogs, the latter generally of the pariah variety; but
now and again in the southern islands a mongrel chow is met
with, a cross between the chow and some animal brought
thither by the Chinese junks. All are the descendants of
introduced species. They are fed on little else but coconut,
and support life on this and the results of their own foraging.
Pigeons, parrots, and monkeys are occasionally to be seen in
captivity, but the natives have not attempted to systematically
utilise the megapode; all the laying-places near the
villages are, however, known, and periodically overhauled for
eggs.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>Weapons, in the strict sense of the word, do not exist now
among the Nicobarese; they possess no shields, swords, clubs,
or spears for warlike purposes only. The Burmese <i>d&aacute;o</i>, their
most common implement&mdash;obtained from the ship-traders&mdash;is
used for everyday purposes and for house-building, agriculture,
canoe-fitting, etc., while the spears and harpoons used for pig-killing,
cattle-hunting, and fishing are nearly all constructed by
attaching a suitable haft to the variously shaped heads which
are made locally. A fishing spear of native make is of the
many-pronged wooden type (Mal., <i>s'rempang</i>) common throughout
the East&mdash;a bunch of diverging barbed skewers spliced into
a haft with lashings of cord or rattan.</p>

<p>The Shom Pe&#7749; manufacture a javelin or dart, which is used
indiscriminately for warfare or the chase as occasion may require;
it is made of a single piece of heavy wood, and is possibly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
same kind of implement as was in general use among the Nicobarese
before the introduction of iron heads.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Fifty and more years ago, the natives obtained numbers of
muskets&mdash;of which they were much afraid&mdash;by barter with European
traders; but recently the Indian Government has prohibited the
possession of these weapons, and whenever any are discovered they
are immediately confiscated.</p>

<p>In common with the other Malayan peoples, they do not
seriously employ the bow and arrow. Crossbows are in use
among them for shooting birds, but it is evident that such
implements are not the invention of the natives. The stock
is fashioned like a gun-butt, and the arrow rests in a groove
running along the top of the fore-end, and is kept in position
by means of three half-hoop pegs of brass wire. The bow is
perfectly round in section, tapering towards the ends, and the
release is of the string and peg variety, hitching over the top
of the trigger. The arrows, which are unfeathered and half the
diameter of a lead pencil, have for point a sharpened nail attached
by a wrapping of sheet-tin.</p>

<p>These bows have either been copied from the weapons of
the early voyagers, or, more probably, have been introduced by
the Burmese, amongst whom and the Karens there exists an
article almost exactly similar.</p>

<p>Tools of European model are now common, and for fashioning
canoes, houses, etc., imported axes, saws, adzes, planes, and
spokeshaves are used, in addition to the <i>d&aacute;o</i>.</p>

<p>The latter is never fitted with a handle, and from constant
use of it thus, thick ridges of skin and corns form on the inside
of the natives' hands. It is found that the bare tang is very
convenient for picking up coconuts; for retaining the weapon
when up in the palm trees, by sticking it into the bark, thus
leaving both hands free; for punching two holes in the opposite
sides of a nut, through which the water may be extracted by
suction; and for many other purposes.</p>

<p>The Nicobarese rarely use nets for fishing. Besides occasionally
employing small casting nets purchased from traders,&mdash;the
construction of which they never themselves attempt&mdash;they make
and use a primitive net trap, which is baited and held a foot or
two below the surface by the fisherman, who, on seeing a fish
nibbling at the bait, promptly raises the trap, thereby catching
the fish in the netting.</p>

<p>The fish are obtained either by hook and line (imported),
or by spearing by day or at night with the aid of blazing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
torches of coconut leaf. Open-meshed traps of rattan, of
various sizes and shapes, with funnel-shaped mouth leading
towards the interior, are in common use, and are sunk in the
sea-bottom in suitable places. They also construct weirs of
coconut leaves (<i>Tan&aacute;nga</i>&mdash;Kar Nicobar; <i>Kan-Sh&aacute;ng</i>&mdash;Nankauri),
by means of which large quantities of fish are generally caught.
These are employed only during the dry season when the sea
is fairly calm.</p>

<p>Finally, the narcotic property possessed by the seeds of
<i>Barringtonia speciosa</i><a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> is made use of; for, in pools and confined
waters, the addition of a small quantity of a paste, made of the
mashed kernels, acts like "tuba," causing all the fish present to
become insensible and rise to the surface, where they may be
collected at leisure.</p>

<p>Turtle are common about the islands, and many skulls are
to be met with in the houses of the natives, by whom they are
used for the expulsion of demons. They are captured when
floating on the sea by means of a harpoon with a skewer-shaped
iron head, which, when fast in the shell, detaches from the shaft
and remains connected by a short piece of cord only.</p>

<p>Large quantities of fish are often caught, when the weather
is favourable, by means of the <i>kan-sh&aacute;ng</i>, traps, etc., and, consequently,
at times the natives live largely on fish. The staples
of food throughout the year are coconuts and pandanus fruit,
with bananas, yams, and occasionally other fruits and vegetables
in small quantities. Fowls and pork can only be afforded now
and then. Rice is used to a small extent, and is one of the
articles for which the natives barter coconuts.</p>

<p>The fruit of the pandanus, which is an egg-shaped mass
frequently attaining a diameter of 18 inches, consists of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
cluster of fibrous drupes, the tops of which are sliced off as soon
as gathered. Thus treated, it can be preserved for some weeks.</p>

<p>When preparing it for eating, these divisions are separated
from the central core and placed in a pot over a layer of bamboos
or a grating,<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> below which there is a little water; above
them are laid yams, or whatever may be suitably cooked by
that process, and the whole is then covered with leaves and
steamed for some hours.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>The pulpy matter that it contains is then scraped out with
a shell while the drupe is held on a heavy slab of wood, and
then the bristly fibres with which the nutritious portion is intermixed
are extracted from the latter by drawing threads of a
sort of bass through the pasty mass resulting. Thus is obtained
a smooth dough, of a yellowish colour and somewhat sweet
taste, that has been likened in flavour to apple-marmalade. A
portion of this (<i>kow-en</i>), with some grated coconut, and sometimes
a piece of chicken or pork, constitutes the usual meal.</p>

<p>This food is often made up into leaf-covered bundles, in
which state it acquires a distinctive, though not unpleasant,
odour, and can be kept a long time.</p>

<p>The fibrous drupe, after treatment as above, is commonly
used as a foot-brush<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> at many of the islands, for which purpose
it is kept near the top of the hut-ladder for those entering the hut.</p>

<p>The principal beverages are the water of the green unripe
coconut, and toddy, made by fermenting the sap of the coco palm,
which is regularly bled at the crown into bamboo receptacles.
The toddy is largely manufactured, and as it is no more intoxicating
than strong ale, much has to be consumed before drunkenness
results. Ordinary water is scarcely ever taken, and its use
is almost entirely restricted to cooking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>For the last few years the authorities at Port Blair have
attempted to inculcate in the natives a liking for tea, the taste
for which they have fostered by presenting the headmen with
quantities of the leaf, in the hope that it will, if it become popular,
somewhat minimise the prevalent consumption of toddy, which,
when largely indulged in, cannot but have a bad effect on the
general health of the people.</p>

<p>Toddy, however, does not stand alone as an intoxicant:
nearly everywhere one comes across the black, square bottles
in which gin is conveyed to all parts of the world: occasionally
brandy is inquired for, but on all the islands there is a demand
for rum, and this seems to have been the favourite drink since
it was introduced to the natives by British captains bartering
for coconuts in the early part of the last century. At present,
however, Chinese traders are the only smugglers, and the
spirit they introduce, <i>samshu</i>, runs only occasional risk of
confiscation, as the trade of the junks is for the most
part in places seldom visited by the occasional patrolling
steamer.</p>

<p>Tobacco is used by everyone&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;both
for chewing and smoking: the native cigarette is a very
crude affair, composed of a small quantity of the weed and a
large amount of a certain dried leaf. The tobacco finding most
favour is of Chinese and Javanese manufacture, and cigars are
much appreciated.</p>

<p>Betel-chewing is universal, and the quid&mdash;which undoubtedly
acts as a stimulant&mdash;consists of areca-nut, lime, and the sireh leaf
only, without the addition of gambier. The teeth of the
Nicobarese are both large and prominent, and the continuous
use of betel and tobacco stains them a brown and black colour
that is much admired.</p>

<p>In person, the natives, although generally clean, are less
particular than tropical races as a rule: there are none of the
fenced-in wells (<i>panchurans</i>, or bathing-screens) on the stream
banks that one sees near all the villages of the Malays, but an
occasional bath is taken by pouring the contents of a dozen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
coconut shells over the body.  Clothing gets a rinse in the
sea at intervals by way of cleansing.</p>

<p>At the present time the everyday dress is of red cotton, but
for the first half and more of the last century the fashion ran
all in blue. On ordinary occasions men wear a long strip of
cotton, generally red, passing round the thighs and between the
legs,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and women drape a fathom or two of cotton about the
waist by twisting the ends together; but for other times there
are cotton draperies, <i>sarongs</i>, Chinese coats and trousers, and
also European garments, which, from top-hats to shirts, are in
great demand.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>In the north a chaplet of areca palm spathe with loose ends
(<i>t&aacute;-ch&ouml;kla</i>) is much worn, and the ear-lobes are pierced to retain
short plugs of bamboo, half an inch in diameter, inlaid with
silver and with silver pendants. From Kamorta southward the
common head-dress is a similar chaplet of pandanus leaf (<i>shan&oacute;ang</i>),
or a coloured handkerchief or circlet of calico, and there is a
plain ear-distender, one inch or more in diameter and three
long, often shaped like a wedge: this is replaced on festive
occasions by a large rosette of red and white cotton.</p>

<p>Other ornaments are bangles and anklets, made by twisting
thick silver wire about the limb, and belts and necklaces made
of rupees or smaller coins. Rings are worn, either of silver
or shell.</p>

<p>Face and chest are sometimes covered with vermilion or
saffron paint, but the natives do not employ any form of tattoo
or scarification.</p>

<p>Hair is usually worn short by both sexes, but there is a more
or less distinctive style or fashion at all the islands. On the
occasion of a sudden or violent death at a village all its in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>habitants
are required to shave their heads, and the women
their eyebrows as well.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Mourning for a relative is indicated
in like manner as well as by other observances. With infants
the head is often shaved for a time, and for the next few years
the hair is kept short, in which way it is also worn by all
ages and sexes. Boys as a rule have their heads cropped.</p>

<p>Fairly long hair is worn by many, but in no case is it ever
permitted to grow below the shoulders; at that point it is cut
across horizontally, and then, when bushy, the hair presents
much the appearance represented in Assyrian and Egyptian
records.</p>

<p>The Nicobarese possess no musical instrument of their own
invention, but very occasionally some individual attempts to
produce, without much success, a copy of something he has seen
in the hands of foreigners&mdash;a violin, guitar, etc.</p>

<p>Two instruments are, however, in use among them: one, a
seven-holed flageolet, which is Burmese, and the other, the
<i>danang</i>, borrowed from the Indian "sitar," has three frets, a
string of cane, and two sound-holes.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> "It is a hollowed bamboo,
about 2&frac12; feet long and 3 inches in diameter, along the outside
of which there is stretched from end to end a single string,
made of the threads of a split rattan, and the place under the
string is hollowed, to prevent it from touching. This instrument
is played upon in the same way as a guitar" while rested on
the knee.<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of dancing, singing, and feasting, there
are hardly any organised amusements. The exact forms of the
dances vary, but for special occasions new figures and songs
are composed and assiduously practised. In the north-west,
challenges for canoe races, or processions rather, circulate
amongst the Kar Nicobar villages, and are taken part in by
twenty or thirty men a-side. The large canoes are decorated,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
and the course is a long one&mdash;several miles along the coast
from village to village. As the men sing at the top of their
voices throughout the race, they are generally exhausted at
the finish. The pace is not remarkable, and the canoes keep
abreast throughout, neither seeming to mind which comes in
first.</p>

<p>Wrestling is a favourite pursuit of the boys. There is no
science or cunning displayed, and the rounds are very short, one
or the other combatant going down at once.</p>

<p>Pig processions are a pastime indulged in by young men.
A pig is tied beneath a pole, and, with one of their number
seated astride of it, is borne, with songs, about the village by a
party of youths in the evening.</p>

<p>In such villages as are situated near the calmer waters of
harbours, little children amuse themselves by sailing models of
canoes and junks.</p>

<p>The Nicobarese have no writing or pictography, and their
attempts at ornamental work on articles of general utility are
confined to the finials of the houses, the stem and stern posts
of their canoes, and a little decorative carving on their wooden
dishes.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Nevertheless, in the charms and talismans connected
with their superstitious cult they betray a certain artistic ability,
and their pictures, screens, and figures of birds, men, and animals,
show not only good powers of observation, but a capacity and
skill of no mean order, in interpreting and reproducing whatever
may present itself to them.</p>

<p>As concerns metals, it appears that 200 years ago Jesuit
missionaries discovered tin on Great Nicobar. Having regard
to the proximity of the rich deposits of this metal in Sumatra
and the Malayan Peninsula, it seems not improbable that the
statement will some day be verified. At Kar Nicobar small
quantities of iron pyrites are found. The art of working in iron
is almost confined to Chaura, where the <i>mer&aacute;htas</i> and the best
spear-heads are manufactured. The latter are, however, made
at the other islands as well. Of weaving they have no knowledge,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and prior to the introduction of cotton and cloth garments they
clothed themselves in <i>tapa</i> or cloth made of the beaten bark
of a tree at present believed to be the <i>Ficus brevicuspis</i>, also
with girdles of split coconut leaves.</p>

<p>They are, however, expert basketmakers, and many-shaped
baskets for various purposes are manufactured in different patterns
of mesh, entirely out of the strips of rattan, or of the bark of
the <i>Maranta dichotoma</i>.</p>

<p>What the sago is to the Papuan, the pandanus is to the Nicobarese,
and its luxuriant natural growth renders unnecessary
any extensive agricultural labour on his part. The other great
support of life&mdash;the coconut&mdash;once planted, thrives without
further attention, and for the rest, his fruits, bananas, and
yams, require but the slightest amount of cultivation. The
implement used in all cases seems to be the <i>d&aacute;o</i> only.</p>

<p>The islands produce no artificial material, and no raw merchandise
is imported. Among themselves the natives trade in little
more than pottery and canoes, and the only stores or bazaars are
kept by foreigners who barter with the inhabitants. Coconuts,
betel-nuts, rattan, mother-o'-pearl shells, trepang, and edible
birds' nests, are the only trade commodities. The two latter
are of minor importance, and are collected directly by the
traders; the rattan comes from Great Nicobar only. Ambergris,
for which the Nicobars were most noted in the Middle Ages,
is still found, principally in the vicinity of Nankauri Harbour,
and sold to traders.</p>

<p>All traders visiting the Nicobars have to obtain, either from
Port Blair or from one of the local Government Agents, a
license, at a cost of 1 rupee per man of the crew, which grants
them "permission to visit ... for the purpose of trade during
the present north-east monsoon season, on the condition
that no person who may proceed thither by the vessel shall be
permitted to remain behind ... after her departure."</p>

<span class="caption">BASKETS, TROUGHS, AND ARECA SPATHE FEEDING-DISH, NICOBAR ISLANDS.</span>
</div>

<p>Disagreements between the traders and natives are frequent,
and, for the most part, seem due to the dishonesty and high-handed
behaviour of the former. They get the natives into their debt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>&mdash;often
forcing them to accept things they do not require&mdash;falsify
accounts, and even resort at times to acts of violence
for which they have incurred punishment at Port Blair.</p>

<p>The merchants arrive in various kinds of vessels, from large
barquentines, brigs, brigantines, and schooners, to the <i>baglas</i>
of the Indians and Burmese <i>kallus</i> of 20 or 30 tons. These
come mostly from Calcutta, Bombay, Negapatam, and Moulmein.
The Chinese, of course, come in their national junks, <i>vi&acirc;</i> Singapore,
Acheen, or Penang.</p>

<p>Trade is always carried on by barter; coconuts are the
standard of value, and although dollars and rupees change
hands, they are employed by the natives more as ornaments
than mediums of exchange.</p>

<p>The annual production of coconuts is believed to reach at
the lowest estimate, 15,000,000; about one-third of which are
exported and the remainder consumed and planted.</p>

<p>Except in the northern islands, there are very few paths,
and those merely tracks through grass and jungle; local transport
and intervillage communication at the central and southern islands
are largely carried on by canoe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>DAMPIER'S SOJOURN IN GREAT NICOBAR, AND VOYAGE THENCE
TO ACHEEN IN A CANOE</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">I do</span> not think any excuse is needed for here giving in full
Dampier's narrative of his experiences on Great Nicobar, and
of his voyage thence to Acheen in a native canoe.</p>

<p>His "Voyages" are but little read nowadays; and not only
are the chapters extracted of much interest in themselves, but
they contain a careful record of his observations on the natives
and their life and customs that, in spite of changes, is fairly
accurate even for a description of things at the present day,
with which it may be compared.</p>

<p>Dampier's account of the Nicobars is by far the most full
that we have of the islands in past times, but I have nowhere,
in any reference to them, seen attention drawn to his adventures
in their neighbourhood. His voyage in the canoe was
also a very interesting as well as a somewhat bold undertaking,
for there are times in the south-west monsoon when
it is by no means pleasant to be caught in a small open boat
on that stretch of sea, where, too, the currents run very strongly.</p>

<p>The fever which prostrated himself and companions on
their arrival in Sumatra was doubtless aggravated by exposure
in the canoe, but was in all probability contracted during
their sojourn in Great Nicobar, for all who spend any length
of time on shore there seem certain to suffer from it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The privateer <i>Cygnet of London</i>, Captain Swan, originally
fitted out to trade in the South Seas, in which Dampier made
that part of his voyage round the world, extending from Realejo
in Western Nicaragua to the Nicobars, had left the north-west
coast of Australia on March 12, 1688, and anchored nowhere
until she reached the islands where he was permitted to quit
her.</p>

<p>Since Captain Swan had been left ashore at Mindanao and
his place taken by Read, it had been Dampier's continual
desire to part from the vessel, and he explains in his narrative
the reasons for the captain's objection to his desertion.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"... The 25th day of April 1688 we crossed the equator,
still coasting to the northward, between the island Sumatra
and a range of small islands lying 14 or 15 leagues off it....</p>

<p>"The 29th we saw a sail to the north of us, which we chased,
but it being little wind, we did not come up with her till the
30th day. Then, being within a league of her, Captain Read
went in a canoe and took her, and brought her aboard. She
was a prau with four men in her, belonging to Achin, whither
she was bound. She came from one of those coconut islands
that we passed by, and was laden with coconuts and with
coconut oil. Captain Read ordered his men to take aboard all
the nuts, and as much of the oil as he thought convenient, and
then cut a hole in the bottom of the prau and turned her loose,
keeping the men prisoners.</p>

<p>"It was not for the lucre of the cargo that Captain Read took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
this boat, but to hinder me and some others from going ashore,
for he knew that we were ready to make our escapes, if an
opportunity presented itself; and he thought that, by abusing
and robbing the natives, we should be afraid to trust ourselves
amongst them. But yet this proceeding of his turned to our
greater advantage, as shall be declared hereafter.</p>

<p>"May the 1st, we ran down by the north-west end of the
island Sumatra, within 7 or 8 leagues of the shore. All this
west side of Sumatra which we thus coasted along, our Englishmen
at Fort St George call the west coast simply, without
adding the name Sumatra. The prisoners who were taken the
day before showed us the islands that lie off Achin Harbour,
and the channels through which ships go in; and told us also
that there was an English factory at Achin. I wished myself
there, but was forced to wait with patience till my time was
come.</p>

<p>"We were now directing our course towards the Nicobar
Islands, intending there to clean the ship's bottom in order to
make her sail well.</p>

<p>"The fourth day, in the evening, we had sight of one of the
Nicobar Islands. The southernmost of them lie about 40 leagues
N.N.W. from the N.W. end of the island Sumatra. The most
southerly of them is Nicobar itself, but all the cluster of islands
lying south of the Andaman Islands are called by our seamen
the Nicobar Islands.</p>

<p>"The inhabitants of these islands have no certain converse
with any nation, but as ships pass by them they will come
aboard in their praus and offer their commodities to sale,
never inquiring of what nation they are; for all white people
are alike to them. Their chiefest commodities are ambergris
and fruits.</p>

<p>"Ambergris is often found by the native Indians of these
islands, who know it very well; as also know how to cheat
ignorant strangers with a certain mixture like it. Several of
our men bought such of them for a small purchase. Captain
Weldon also about this time touched at some of these islands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
where we lay, and I saw a great deal of such ambergris that
one of his men bought there; but it was not good, having no
smell at all. Yet I saw some there very good and
fragrant.</p>

<p>"At that island<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> where Captain Weldon was there were two
friars, sent thither to convert the Indians. One of them came
away with Captain Weldon; the other remained there still.
He that came away with Captain Weldon gave a very good
character to the inhabitants of that island, viz., that they were
very honest, civil, harmless people; that they were not addicted
to quarrelling, theft, or murder; that they did marry, or
at least live as man and wife, one man with one woman,
never changing till death made the separation; that they
were punctual and honest in performing their bargains; and
that they were inclined to receive the Christian religion.
This relation I had afterwards from the mouth of a priest at
Tonquin who told me that he received this information by a
letter from the friar that Captain Weldon brought away from
thence."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>But, to proceed:&mdash;"The 5th day of May we ran down on the
west side of the island Nicobar properly so-called, and anchored
at the N.W. end of it, in a small bay, in 8 fathoms water, not
half a mile from the shore. The body of this island is in 7&deg; 30'
N. lat.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It is about 12 leagues long, and 3 or 4 broad. The
south end of it is pretty high, with steep cliffs against the sea;
the rest of the island is low, flat, and even.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The mould of it
is black and deep, and it is very well watered with small running
streams. It produceth abundance of tall trees, fit for any uses;
for the whole bulk of it seems to be but one entire grove. But
that which adds most to its beauty off at sea, are the many spots<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
of coconut trees which grow round it in every small bay. The
bays are half a mile or a mile long, more or less, and these
bays are intercepted or divided from each other with as many
little rocky points of woodland.</p>

<p>"As the coconut trees do thus grow in groves, fronting to
the sea, in the bays, so there is another sort of fruit-tree in the
bays, bordering on the back side of the coco trees, farther from
the sea. It is called by the natives a melory tree.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> This tree
is as big as our large apple trees, and as high. It hath a blackish<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
rind and a pretty broad leaf. The fruit is as big as the bread-fruit<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
at Guam, or a large penny loaf. It is shaped like a pear,
and hath a pretty tough smooth rind of a light-green colour.
The inside of the fruit is in substance much like an apple, but
full of small strings as big as brown thread. I did never see
of these trees anywhere but here.</p>

<p>"The natives of this island are tall, well-limbed men; pretty
long visaged, with black eyes; their noses middle-proportioned,
and the whole symmetry of their faces agreeing very well. Their
hair is black and lank, and their skins of a dark copper colour.
The women have no hair on their eyebrows. I do believe it
is plucked up by the roots, for the men had hair growing on
their eyebrows as other people.</p>

<p>"The men go all naked; only a long, narrow piece of cloth
or sash, which, going round their waists, and thence down between
their thighs, is brought up behind and tucked-in at that part
which goes about the waist. The women have a kind of a short
petticoat, reaching from their waists to their knees.</p>

<p>"Their language was different from any that I ever heard
before; yet they had some few Malayan words, and some of
them had a word or two of Portuguese, which, probably, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
might learn aboard of their ships passing by this place; for
when these men see a sail, they do presently go aboard of them
in their canoes. I did not perceive any form of religion that
they had; they had neither temple or idol, nor any manner of
outward veneration to any deity, that I did see.</p>

<p>"They inhabit all round the island by the seaside, in the bays,
there being four or five houses, more or less in each bay. Their
houses are built on posts, as the Mindanayans. They are small,
low, and of a square form. There is but one room in each house,
and this room is about 8 feet from the ground; and from thence
the roof is raised about 8 feet higher. But instead of a sharp
ridge, the top is exceeding neatly arched with small rafters
about the bigness of a man's arm, bent round like a half-moon,
and very curiously thatched with palmetto leaves.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>"They live under no government that I could perceive, for
they seem to be equal, without any distinction; every man
ruling in his own house. Their plantations are only those
coconut trees which grow by the seaside, there being no
cleared land farther in on the island; for I observed that
when past the fruit-trees, there were no paths to be seen going
into the woods. The greatest use which they make of their
coco-trees is to draw toddy from them, of which they are very
fond.</p>

<p>"The melory trees seem to grow wild. They have great
earthen pots to boil the melory fruit in, which will hold 12 or
14 gallons. These pots they fill with the fruit, and, putting in
a little water, they cover the mouth of the pot with leaves to
keep the steam while it boils. When the fruit is soft, they
peel off the rind and the pulp from the strings, with a flat
stick made like a knife, and then make it up into great lumps
as big as a Holland cheese, and then it will keep six or seven
days. It looks yellow, and tastes well, and is their chiefest
food; for they have no yams, potatoes, rice nor plantains (except
a very few), yet they have a few small hogs, and a very few<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
cocks and hens like ours. The men employ themselves in fishing,
but I did not see much fish that they got; every house
hath at least two or three canoes belonging to it, which they
draw up ashore.</p>

<p>"The canoes that they go fishing in are sharp at both ends,
and both the sides and the bottom are very thin and smooth.
They are shaped somewhat like the praus at Guam, with one
side flattish and the other with a pretty big belly; and they
have small slight outlayers<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> on one side. Being thus thin and
light, they are better managed with oars than with sails: yet
they sail well enough, and are steered with a paddle. There
commonly go twenty or thirty men in one of these canoes;
and seldom fewer than nine or ten. Their oars are short,
and they do not paddle, but row with them as we do.<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The
benches they sit on when they row are made of split bamboos
laid across, and so near together that they look like a deck.
The bamboos lie movable: so that when any go in to row
they take up a bamboo in the place where they would sit, and
lay it by to make room for their legs. The canoes of those of
the rest of these islands were like those of Nicobar, and probably
they were alike in other things; for we saw no difference at
all in the natives of them who came hither while we were
here.</p>

<p>"But, to proceed with our affairs: it was, as I said before,
the 5th day of May, about ten in the morning, when we anchored
at this island. Captain Read immediately ordered his men to
heel the ship, in order to clean her, which was done this day and
the next. All the water-vessels were filled; they intended to go
to sea at night, for the winds being yet at N.N.E., the captain
was in hopes to get over to Cape Comorin before the wind
shifted. Otherwise it would have been somewhat difficult for
him to get thither, because the westerly monsoon was not at
hand.</p>

<p>"I thought now was my time to make my escape, by getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
leave, if possible, to stay here: for it seemed not very feasible
to do it by stealth, and I had no reason to despair of getting
leave, this being a place where my stay could, probably, do the
crew no harm, should I design it. Indeed, one reason that put
me on the thoughts of staying at this particular place, besides
the present opportunity of leaving Captain Read, which I did
always intend to do as soon as I could, was that I had here
also a prospect of advancing a profitable trade for ambergris with
these people, and of gaining a considerable fortune to myself.
For in a short time I might have learned their language, and by
accustoming myself to row with them in their praus or canoes&mdash;especially
by conforming myself to their customs and manners
of living&mdash;should have seen how they got their ambergris, and
have known what quantities they got, and the time of the year
when it most is found. And then afterwards I thought it would
be easy for me to have transported myself from thence, either
in some ship that passed that way, whether English, Dutch or
Portuguese, or else to have gotten one of the young men of the
island to have gone with me in one of their canoes to Achin,
and there to have furnished myself with such commodities as I
found most coveted by them, and therewith, at my return, to
have bought their ambergris.</p>

<p>"I had, till this time, made no open show of going ashore
here; but now, the water being filled and the ship in readiness
to sail, I desired Captain Read to set me ashore on this island.
He, supposing that I could not go ashore in a place less frequented
by ships than this, gave me leave; which possibly he would
have refused to have done if he thought I should have gotten
from hence in any short time, for fear of my giving an account
of him to the English or Dutch. I soon got up my chest and
bedding, and immediately got some to row me ashore, for fear
lest his mind should change again.</p>

<p>"The canoe that brought me ashore landed me on a small
sandy bay, where there were two houses, but no person in them.
For the inhabitants were removed to some other house, probably
for fear of us; because the ship was close by: and yet both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
men and women came aboard the ship without any sign of fear.
When our ship's canoe was going aboard again, they met the
owner of the houses coming ashore in his boat. He made a
great many signs to them to fetch me off again, but they
would not understand him. Then he came to me, and offered
his boat to carry me off, but I refused it. Then he made signs
to me to go up into the house, and, according as I did understand
him by his signs, and a few Malayan words that he used,
he intimated that somewhat would come out of the woods in
the night, when I was asleep, and kill me, meaning, probably,
some wild beast. Then I carried my chest and clothes up into
the house.</p>

<p>"I had not been ashore an hour before Captain Teat and
one John Damerel, with three or four men more, came to fetch me
aboard again. They need not have sent an armed <i>poss&eacute;</i> for
me, for had they but sent the cabin-boy ashore for me, I would
not have denied going aboard. For though I could have hid
myself in the woods, yet then they would have abused, or have
killed, some of the natives, purposely to incense them against
me. I told them, therefore, that I was ready to go with them,
and went aboard with all my things.</p>

<p>"When I came aboard, I found the ship in an uproar; for
there were three men more, who, taking courage by my example,
desired leave also to accompany me. One of these was the
surgeon, Mr Coppinger, the other was Mr Robert Hall, and one
named Ambrose&mdash;I have forgot his surname. These men had
always harboured the same designs as I had. The two last were
not much opposed, but Captain Read and his crew would not
part with the surgeon. At last the surgeon leaped into the
canoe, and, taking up my gun, swore he would go ashore, and
that if any man did oppose it, he would shoot him. But John
Oliver, who was the quarter-master, leaped into the canoe,
taking hold of him, took away the gun, and with the help of two
or three more, they dragged him again into the ship.</p>

<p>"Then Mr Hall, and Ambrose, and I were again sent ashore;
and one of the men that rowed us ashore stole an axe and gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
it to us, knowing it was a good commodity with the Indians.
It was now dark, therefore we lighted a candle, and I, being the
oldest stander in our new country, conducted them into one of
the houses, where we did presently hang up our hammocks. We
had scarce done this before the canoe came ashore again, and
brought the four Malayan men belonging to Achin (which we took
in the prau we took off Sumatra), and the Portuguese that came
to our ship out of the Siam junk at Pulo Condore: the crew
having no occasion for these, being leaving the Malayan parts
where the Portuguese spark served as an interpreter; and not
fearing now that the Achinese could be serviceable to us in
bringing us over to their country, 40 leagues off; not imagining
we durst make such an attempt; as, indeed, it was a bold one.
Now we were men enough to defend ourselves against the
natives of the island, if they should prove our enemies; though
if none of these men had come ashore to me, I should not have
feared any danger. Nay, perhaps less, because I should have
been cautious of giving any offence to the natives: and I am of
the opinion that there are no people in the world so barbarous
as to kill a single person that falls accidentally into their hands,
or comes to live among them, except they have been injured by
some outrage or violence committed against them. Yet, even
then, or afterwards, if a man could but preserve his life from
their first rage, and come to treat with them (which is the hardest
thing, because their way is usually to abscond, and rushing
suddenly on their enemy, to kill him unawares), one might by some
slight, insinuate oneself into their favours again. Especially
by showing some toy or knack that they did never see before,
which any European that hath seen the world might soon contrive
to amuse them withal: as might be done generally with a little
fire struck with a flint and steel....</p>

<p>"As for these Nicobar people, I found them affable enough,
and therefore I did not fear them; but I did not much care
whether I had gotten any more company or no.</p>

<p>"But, however, I was very well satisfied, and the rather
because we were now men enough to row ourselves over to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the island Sumatra; and accordingly we presently consulted
how to purchase a canoe from the natives.</p>

<p>"It was a fine clear moonlight night in which we were
left ashore, therefore we walked in the sandy bay to watch
when the ship would weigh and be gone, not thinking ourselves
secure in our new gotten liberty till then. About eleven
or twelve o'clock we saw her under sail, and then we returned
to our chamber, and so to sleep; this was the 6th of May.</p>

<p>"The next morning betimes, our landlord with four or five
of his friends came to see his new guests, and was somewhat
surprised to see so many of us, for he knew of no more than
myself. Yet he seemed to be very well pleased, and entertained
us with a large calabash of toddy which he brought
with him. Before he went away again (for wheresoever we
came they left their houses to us, but whether out of fear or
superstition I know not) we bought a canoe of his for an axe, and
we did presently put our chests and clothes in it, designing to
go to the south end of the island, and be there till the monsoon
shifted, which we expected every day.</p>

<p>"When our things were stowed away, we with the Achinese
entered with joy into our new frigate, and launched off from
the shore. We were no sooner off but our canoe overset,
bottom upwards. We preserved our lives well enough by
swimming, and dragged also our chests and clothes ashore;
but all our things were wet. I had nothing of value but my
journal and some drafts of land of my own taking, which I
much prized, and which I had hitherto carefully preserved: Mr
Hall had also such another cargo of books and drafts, which
were now like to perish. But we presently opened our chests
and took out our books, which, with much ado, we did afterwards
dry; but some of our drafts that lay loose in our chests
were spoiled.</p>

<p>"We lay here afterwards three days, making great fires to dry
our books. The Achinese in the meantime fixed our canoe
with outlayers on each side; and they also cut a good mast
for her, and made a substantial sail with mats.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"The canoe being now very well fixed, and our books and
clothes dry, we launched out the second time, and rowed towards
the east side of the island, leaving many islands to the north
of us. The Indians of the island accompanied us with eight or
ten canoes against our desire; for we thought that these men
would make provision dearer at that side of the island we
were going to, by giving an account what rates we gave for
it at the place from whence we came, which was owing to the
ships being there, for the ship's crew were not so thrifty in
bargaining (as they seldom are) as single persons or a few men
might be apt to be who would keep to one bargain. Therefore,
to hinder them from going with us, Mr Hall scared one canoe's
crew by firing a shot over them; they all leaped overboard
and cried out, but seeing us row away they got into their
canoe again and rowed after us.</p>

<p>"The firing of that gun made all the inhabitants of the
island to be our enemies. For presently after this we put
ashore at a bay where were four houses and a great many
canoes; but they all went away, and came near to us no more
for several days. We had then a great loaf of melory, which
was our constant food; and if we had a mind to coconuts or
toddy, our Malayans of Achin would climb the trees and fetch
as many nuts as we would have, and a good pot of toddy
every morning. Thus we lived till our melory was almost
spent; being still in hopes that the natives would come to
us, and sell it as they had formerly done. But they came not
to us; nay, they opposed us wherever we came, and after
shaking their lances at us, made all the show of hatred that
they could invent.</p>

<p>"At last, when we saw that they stood in opposition to us,
we resolved to use force to get some of their food, if we could
not get it other ways. With this resolution, we went in our
canoe to a small bay on the north part of the island, because
it was smooth water there, and good landing; but on the other
side, the wind being yet on that quarter, we could not land
without jeopardy of oversetting our canoe, and wetting our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
arms, and then we must have lain at the mercy of our enemies,
who stood, 200 or 300 men in every bay where they saw us
coming, to keep us off.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>"When we set out we rowed directly to the north end,
and presently were followed by seven or eight of their canoes.
They, keeping at a distance, rowed away faster than we did,
and got to the bay before us; and there, with about twenty
more canoes full of men, they all landed and stood to hinder
us from landing. But we rowed in within 100 yards of them.
Then we lay still, and I took up my gun and presented at
them, at which they all fell down flat on the ground. But I
turned myself about, and to show that we did not intend to
harm them, I fired my gun off to sea, so that they might
see the shot graze on the water. As soon as my gun was
loaded again, we rowed gently in; at which some of them
withdrew. The rest, standing up, did still cut and hew the
air, making signs of their hatred; till I once more frightened
them with my gun, and discharged it as before. Then more
of them sneaked away, leaving only five or six men on the
bay. Then we rowed in again, and Mr Hall, taking his sword
in his hand, leaped ashore; and I stood ready with my gun
to fire at the Indians if they had injured him, but they did
not stir, till he came to them, and saluted them.</p>

<p>"He shook them by the hand, and by such signs of friendship
as he made, the peace was concluded, ratified, and confirmed
by all that were present; and others that were gone were
again called back, and they all very joyfully accepted of a peace.
This became universal all over the island, to the great joy of
the inhabitants. There was no ringing of bells, nor bonfires
made, for that is not the custom here, but gladness appeared
in their countenances, for now they could go out and fish
again without fear of being taken. This peace was not more
welcome to them than to us; for now the inhabitants brought
their melory again to us, which we bought for old rags and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
small strips of cloth as broad as the palm of one's hand. I
did not see above five or six hens, for they have but few on
the island. At some places we saw some small hogs, which
we could have bought of them reasonably; but we would not
offend our Achinese friends, who were Mahometans.</p>

<p>"We stayed here two or three days, and then rowed towards
the south end of the island, keeping on the east side, and we
were kindly received by the natives wherever we came. When
we arrived at the south end of the island, we fitted ourselves with
melory and water. We bought three or four loaves of melory,
and about twelve large coconut shells that had all kernel taken
out, yet were preserved whole, except only a small hole at one
end; and all these held for us about 3&frac12; gallons of water. We
bought also two or three bamboos that held about 4 or 5 gallons
more. This was our sea-store.</p>

<p>"We now designed to go to Achin, a town on the N.W. end
of the island Sumatra, distant from hence about 40 leagues,
bearing S.S.E. We only waited for the western monsoon, which
we had expected a great while, and now it seemed to be at
hand; for the clouds began to hang their heads to the eastward,
and at last moved gently that way, and though the wind was
still at east, yet this was an infallible sign that the western
monsoon was nigh.</p>

<p>(Ch. xviii.).&mdash;"It was the 15th day of May 1688, about four
o'clock in the afternoon, when we left Nicobar Island, directing
our course towards Achin, being eight men of us in company,
viz., three English, four Malayans who were born at Achin,
and the mongrel Portuguese.</p>

<p>"Our vessel, the Nicobar canoe, was not one of the biggest,
nor of the least size. She was much about the burthen of one
of our London wherries below Bridge, and built sharp at both
ends, like the forepart of a wherry. She was deeper than a
wherry, but not so broad, and was so thin and light that when
empty four men could launch her or hale her ashore on a
sandy bay. We had a good substantial mast, and a mat sail,
and good outlayers lashed very fast and firm on each side the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
vessel, being made of strong poles. So that while these continued
firm, the vessel could not overset, which she would
easily have done without them, and with them too, had they
not been made very strong; and we were therefore much beholden
to our Achinese companions for this contrivance.</p>

<p>"These men were none of them so sensible of the danger
as Mr Hall and myself, for they all confided so much in us,
that they did not so much as scruple anything we did approve
of. Neither was Mr Hall so well provided as I was, for before
we left the ship, I had purposely consulted our draft of the
East Indies (which we had but one in the ship), and out of
that I had written in my pocket-book an account of the bearing
and distance of all the Malacca coast, and that of Sumatra,
Pegu, and all Siam, and also brought away with me a pocket
compass for my direction in any enterprise that I should
undertake.</p>

<p>"The weather at our setting out was very fair, clear, and
hot. The wind was still at S.E., a very small breeze, just fanning
the air, and the clouds were moving gently from west to east,
which gave us hopes that the winds were either at west already
abroad at sea, or would be so in a very short time. We took
this opportunity of fair weather, being in hopes to accomplish
our voyage to Achin before the western monsoon was set in
strong, knowing that we should have very blusterous weather
after this fair weather, especially at the first-coming of the
western monsoon.</p>

<p>"We rowed, therefore, away to the southward, supposing that
when we were clear from the island we should have a true wind,
as we call it; for the land hales the wind; and we often find
the wind at sea different from what it is near the shore. We
rowed with four oars, taking our time. Mr Hall and I steered
also by turns, for none of the rest were capable of it. We
rowed the first afternoon and the night ensuing about 12
leagues by my judgment. Our course was S.S.E.; but the
16th day, in the morning, when the sun was an hour high, we
saw the island whence we came, bearing N.W. by N. Therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
I found we had gone a point more to the east than I intended,
for which reason we steered S. by E.</p>

<p>"In the afternoon at four o'clock we had a gentle breeze at
W.S.W., which continued so till nine, all which time we laid down
our oars, and steered away S.S.E. I was then at the helm, and
I found by the ripplings of the sea that there was a strong
current against us. It made a great noise that might be heard
half a mile. At nine o'clock it fell calm, and so continued till
ten. Then the wind sprung up again, and blew a fresh breeze
all night.</p>

<p>"The 17th day, in the morning, we looked out for the island
Sumatra, supposing that we were now within 20 leagues of it,
and the distance from Nicobar to Achin is 40 leagues. But we
looked in vain for the island Sumatra, for, turning ourselves
about we saw, to our grief, Nicobar Island lying W.N.W., and
not above 8 leagues distant. By this it was visible that we
had met a very strong current against us in the night. But the
wind freshened on us, and we made the best use of it while the
weather continued fair. At noon we had an observation of the
sun; my lat. was 6&deg; 55', and Mr Hall's was 7&deg; N.</p>

<p>"The 18th day the wind freshened on us again, and the sky
began to be clouded. It was indifferent clear till noon, and we
thought to have had an observation; but we were hindered by
the clouds that came on the face of the sun when it came on the
meridian. This oftens happens, that we are disappointed of
making observations by the sun's being clouded at noon, though
it shines clear both before and after, especially in places near
the sun; and this obscuring of the sun at noon is commonly
sudden and unexpected, and for about half an hour or more.</p>

<p>"We had then also a very ill passage (presage?), by a great
circle about the sun (five or six times the diameter of it), which
seldom appears but storms of wind, or much rain, ensue. Such
circles about the moon are more frequent, but of less import. We
do commonly take great notice of these that are about the sun,
observing if there be any breach in the circle, and in what quarter
the breach is; for from thence we commonly find the greatest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
stress of the wind will come. I must confess that I was a little
anxious at the sight of the circle, and wished heartily that we
were near some land. Yet I showed no sign of it to discourage
my consorts, but made a virtue of necessity, and put a good
countenance on the matter.</p>

<p>"I told Mr Hall that if the wind became too strong and
violent, as I feared it would, it being even then very strong, we
must of necessity steer away before the wind and sea till better
weather presented; and that as the winds were now, we should,
instead of about 20 leagues to Achin, be driven 60 or 70 to
the coast of Cudda or Queda (Kedah) a kingdom and town and
harbour of trade on the coast of Malacca.</p>

<p>"The winds, therefore, bearing very hard, we rolled up the
foot of our sail on a pole fastened to it, and settled our yard
within 3 feet of the canoe sides, so that we had now but a
small sail; yet it was still too big considering the winds, for
the wind being on our broadside, pressed her down very much,
though supported by her outlayers, in so much that the poles
of the outlayers going from the sides of the vessel bent as if
they would break; and should they have broken, our overturning
and perishing had been inevitable. Besides, the sea
increasing, would soon have filled the sea this way. Yet thus
we made a shift to bear up with the side of the vessel against
the wind for a while; but the wind still increasing about one
o'clock in the afternoon, we put right away before wind and
sea, continuing to run thus all the afternoon and part of the
night ensuing. The wind continued increasing all the afternoon,
and the sea still swelled higher, and often broke, but did us
no damage; for the ends of the vessel being very narrow, he
that steered received and broke the sea on his back, and so
kept it from coming in so much as to endanger the vessel:
though much water would come in, which we were forced to
keep heaving out continually. And by this time we saw it was
well we had altered our course, every wave would else have filled
and sunk us, taking the side of the vessel; and though our
outlayers were well lashed down to the canoe's bottom with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
rattans, yet they must probably have yielded to such a sea
as this, when even before they were plunged under water, and
bent like twigs.</p>

<p>"The evening of this 18th day was very dismal. The sky
looked very black, being covered with dark clouds; the wind
blew hard, and the seas ran high. The sea was already roaring
in a white foam about us; a dark night coming on, and no land
in sight to shelter us, and our little ark in danger to be swallowed
by every wave; and what was worst of all, none of us thought
ourselves prepared for another world. The reader may better
guess than I can express, the confusion that we were all in. I
had been in many eminent dangers before now, some of which I
have already related, but the worst of them all was a play-game
in comparison with this. I must confess I was in great conflicts
of mind at this time. Other dangers came not upon me
with such a leisurely and dreadful solemnity. A sudden skirmish
or engagement or so was nothing when one's blood was up, and
pushed forward with eager expectations. But here I had a
lingering view of approaching death, and little or no hopes of
escaping it; and I must confess that my courage, which I had
hitherto kept up, failed me here; and I made very sad reflections
of my former life, and looked back with horror and detestation
on actions which before I disliked, and I now trembled at the
remembrance of. I had long before this repented me of that
roving course of life, but never with such concern as now. I
did also call to mind many miraculous acts of God's providence
towards me in the whole course of my life, of which kind I believe
few men have met with the like. For all these I returned
thanks in a peculiar manner, and this once more desired God's
assistance, and composed my mind as well as I could in the
hopes of it; and, as the event showed, I was not disappointed of
my hopes.</p>

<p>"Submitting ourselves, therefore, to God's good providence,
and taking all care we could to preserve our lives, Mr Hall
and I took turns to steer, and the rest took turns to heave out
the water, and thus we provided to spend the most doleful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
night I ever was in. About ten o'clock it began to thunder,
lighten, and rain; but the rain was very welcome to us, having
drank up all the water we brought from the island.</p>

<p>"The wind at first blew harder than before, but within half
an hour it abated and become more moderate, and the sea
also assuaged of its fury; and then by a lighted match, of
which we kept a piece burning on purpose, we looked on our
compass to see how we steered, and found our course to be
still east. We had no occasion to look on the compass before,
for we steered right before the wind, which if it shifted we
had been obliged to have altered our course accordingly. But
now it being abated, we found our vessel lively enough, with
that small sail which was then aboard, to hale our former course
S.S.E., which accordingly we did, being now in hopes again to
get to the island Sumatra.</p>

<p>"But about two o'clock in the morning of the 19th day,
we had another gust of wind, with much thunder, lightning,
and rain, which lasted till day, and obliged us to put before
the wind again, steering thus for several hours. It was very
dark, and the hard rain soaked us so thoroughly that we had
not one dry thread about us. The rain chilled us extremely:
for any fresh water is much colder than that of the sea. For
even in the coldest climates the sea is warm, and in the hottest
climates the rain is cold and unwholesome for man's body. In
this wet starveling plight we spent the tedious night. Never
did poor mariners on a lee-shore more earnestly long for the
dawning light than we did now. At length the day appeared,
but with such dark black clouds near the horizon, that the
first glimpse of the dawn appeared 30 or 40 degrees high, which
was dreadful enough: for it is a common saying among seamen,
and true, as I have experienced, that a high dawn will have
high winds, and a low dawn small winds.</p>

<p>"We continued our course still east, before wind and sea,
till about eight o'clock in the morning of the 19th day; and
then one of our Malayan friends cried out, Pulo Way. Mr Hall
and Ambrose and I thought the fellow had said Pull away! an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
expression usual among English seamen when they are rowing.
And we wondered what he meant by it, till we saw him point
to his consorts; and then we looking that way, saw land appearing,
like an island, and all our Malayan friends said it was
an island at the N.W. end of Sumatra, called Way, for Pulo
Way is the island Way. We who were dropping with wet,
cold, and hungry, were all overjoyed at the sight of the land,
and presently marked its bearing. It bore south, and the wind
was still at west, a strong gale, but the sea did not run so high
as in the night. Therefore we trimmed our small sail no bigger
than an apron, and steered with it. Now our outlayers did us
a great kindness again, for although we had but a small sail,
yet the wind was strong and pressed down our vessel's side
very much. But being supported by the outlayers, we could
brook it well enough, which otherwise we could not have
done.</p>

<p>"About noon we saw more land beneath the supposed Pulo
Way, and steering towards it, before night we saw the coast of
Sumatra, and found the errors of our Achinese; for the high
land that we first saw, which then appeared like an island, was
not Pulo Way, but a great high mountain on the island Sumatra,
called by the English the Golden Mountain. Our wind continued
till about seven o'clock at night, then it abated, and at ten o'clock
it died away; and then we stuck to our oars again, though all
of us quite tired with our former fatigues and hardships.</p>

<p>"The next morning, being the 20th day, we saw all the low
land plain, and judged ourselves not above 8 leagues off. About
eight o'clock in the morning we had the wind again at west, a
fresh gale, and steering in still for the shore, at five o'clock in
the afternoon we run to the mouth of a river on the island
Sumatra, called Passange Jonca (Pasangan River).<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> It is 34
leagues to the eastward of Achin and 6 leagues to the west of
Diamond Point, which makes with three angles of a rhombus,
and is low land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our Malayans were very well acquainted here, and carried
us to a small fishing village within a mile of the river's mouth,
called also by the name of the River Passange Jonca.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The
hardships of this voyage, with the scorching heat of the sun
at our first setting-out, and the cold rain, with our continuing
wet for the last two days, cast us all into fevers, so that now
we were not able to help each other, nor so much as to get
our canoe up to the village; but our Malayans got some of
the townsmen to bring her up.... The Malayans that accompanied
us from Nicobar separated themselves from us now,
living at one end of the house by themselves, for they were
Mahometans, as all those of the kingdom of Achin are; and
though during our passage by the sea together we made them
be content to drink their water out of the same coco-shell as
us, yet being now no longer under that necessity, they again
took up their accustomed niceness and reservedness. They all
lay sick, and as their sickness increased, one of them threatened
us that if any of them died, the rest would kill us for having
brought them this voyage; yet I question whether they would
have attempted it, or the country people have suffered it. We
made a shift to dress our own food, for none of these people,
though they were very kind in giving us anything that we
wanted, would yet come near us to assist us in dressing our
victuals. Nay, they would not touch anything that we used.
We had all fevers, and therefore took turns to dress victuals
according as we had strength to do it, or stomachs to eat it. I
found my fever to increase, and my head so distempered that
I could scarce stand; therefore I whetted and sharpened my
penknife in order to let myself blood, but I could not, for my
knife was too blunt.</p>

<p>"We stayed here ten or twelve days, in hopes to recover
our health, but finding no amendment, we desired to go to
Achin.... The natives ... provided a large prau to carry us
thither, we not being able to manage our own canoe. Besides,
before this, three of our Malayan comrades were gone very sick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
into the country, and only one of them and the Portuguese
remained with us, accompanying us to Achin, and they both as
sick as we....</p>

<p>"Three days after our arrival here (Achin) our Portuguese
died of a fever. What became of our Malayans I know not.
Ambrose lived not long after; Mr Hall also was so weak that I
did not think he would recover. I was the best, but still very
sick of a fever, and little likely to live. Therefore Mr Driscol
(an Irishman, and a resident in the factory which our East
India Company had there then) and some other Englishmen
persuaded me to take some purging physic of a Malayan
doctor. I took their advice, being willing to get ease; but
after three doses (each a large calabash of nasty stuff), finding
no amendment, I thought to desist from my physic, but was
persuaded to take one dose more, which I did, and it wrought
so violently that I thought it would have ended my days. It
working so quick with me ... and my strength being almost
spent, I even threw myself down once for all.... I thought
my Malayan doctor, whom they so much commended, would
have killed me outright. I continued extraordinary weak for
some days after his drenching me thus; but my fever left me
for above a week, after which it returned upon me again for
a twelvemonth, and a flux with it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>AN OLD ACCOUNT OF KAR NICOBAR</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">In</span> 1778 Kar Nicobar was visited by Dr I. G. Koenig, a Swede,
and pupil of Linn&aelig;us. He spent many years in India, both as
doctor to the Danish missionaries at Tranquebar, and as naturalist
to the Nabob of Arcot. After visiting different parts of India
and Ceylon, he started on an expedition to Siam and Malacca,
and as his account of the voyage will be but little known to
English readers, I have extracted from it such portions as deal
generally with the island, leaving out a quantity of botanical
matter.</p>

<p>A translation of all Koenig's diaries was made for the Straits
Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, and appears in Nos. 26 and
27 of its Journals.</p>

<p>The account commences with the starting of the ship <i>Bristol</i>
from Madras on August 8, 1778, on its way to Siam.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>"<i>August 31, 1778.</i>&mdash;At 9 o'clock, land was discovered from the
mast. The sails were set and the course directed straight towards
the land. A quarter of an hour later, we could distinguish the
land from the fore deck; it rose before us like smoke, and seemed
to be high and hilly.</p>

<p>"As we approached the land, we could from time to time
distinguish some white, sparkling spots, especially close to the
summit of the mountain; we took them to be chalk stone, but as
we came nearer, we saw that they were a peculiar kind of fields
interspersed with green.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>

<p>"Our captain knew this country very well: it was the first of
the Nequebar<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> islands, which is called 'Kare Nequebar.' He
therefore ordered the ship to be steered towards its north-eastern
coast, in such manner as not to come too near a stony bank
stretching far into the sea. The more we approached the land,
the more agreeable it seemed to the eye, on account of the
pleasant change of wood with green fields, and trees standing in
thin rows between them. There was such perpetual change of
scenery, that it was almost impossible to believe this island to be
inhabited by uncivilized people. One field was specially conspicuous.
It reached in a slope down to the sea, and there was
bordered by a row of thinly planted trees, the waves beating
against it with great violence; in all other parts the sea was
bordered by thick trees like by a wall. After this we passed
another side of the island pretty closely, this coast not being
dangerous at all, and at the same time we came behind the wind.
The ship cast anchor a quarter of a German mile from the shore,
the water being fifteen fathoms deep. It was then 3 o'clock in
the afternoon.</p>

<p>"The country seemed to be level and flat for about one
German mile, and was thickly overgrown with trees down to
the seashore. There were some semicircular openings hewn out,
in which one could perceive several houses with thatched roofs.</p>

<p>"We had scarcely cast anchor, when some of the natives of
Necquebar came in their canoes; they arrived rowing in silence.
Their canoes were long, narrow, and pointed; they were hewn
out of trees, the best of them having a thin staff, about 1&frac12; man's
height, right in front, at the end of which was fastened a little
flag, by means of diametrical pieces of wood; the flag, however,
was not movable, and stood out straight in front. There were
two bamboos tied to the top of the canoe, about 1 foot apart
from each other,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> and at one side there was a kind of wing
fastened to the same, for the purpose of preventing the canoe
from being overset.</p>

<p>"This wing was made of two bamboo sticks as long as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
eighth part of the whole length of the boat, and to these were
tied two other bamboo sticks, which stood out at the two ends;
they were twice as long as the width of the boat, and at the end
of these cross sticks another bamboo was fastened, running
parallel with the boat, and standing out as much at the front
part, as long as the pointed end of the canoe. The smaller boats
all had this arrangement, only they had no staff for the flag.
There were more than eight men rowing the big boats. Their
oars were lancet-shaped as far as the middle, and had a protruding
sharp-cornered point. They were thin and smooth, about 6
inches wide, the handle was round and short, their whole length
being about 4 feet; they were made of a sort of brownish red
wood.</p>

<p>"Those of the natives that came on board were mostly young,
except their captain, who was rather old; he had received a
name from a European captain, who frequently came hither, viz.,
Makintosh.</p>

<p>"Their figure is very much like that of the Malays; they had
round heads thickly covered with short coarse hair, a large
forehead, round small brown eyes, a flat nose, thick lips and
large faces, big teeth red with betel, and thin black beards;
they were of a light brown colour. Their shoulders were large,
and they seemed to be muscular, their veins were more prominent
than is commonly the case with the black, their calves
were very much developed, but they were all only of medium
stature. Their clothing consisted of a piece of coarse blue
linen, about three fingers wide, which was wound several times
round the lower part of their body and taken up between the
legs; some of them wore old straw hats. At first sight the
expression of their face seemed to be wild, but one soon lost
that impression; they showed few signs of any passion, smiled
in drawing their lips up on one side, and when they felt offended
they walked away without any sign of anger. The principal
articles they brought with them were coconuts. Some of
them had little square boxes, the biggest of them being one
foot long; they were made from the sheaths of the young leaves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
of the cham&#339;rops,<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> and they contained many varieties of
amber<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> for sale. There were some pieces of one or two
drachms weight, and they were wrapped in leaves, among them
one kind very much resembling benzoin but not having the
same odour. As much as I could make out from the interpreter,
this piece, like all the other pieces, had been thrown on shore
by the sea; it seemed to have been burnt at one end.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> The
payment for these articles was mostly made in tobacco or blue
linen. My curiosity and longing to see the country were very
great, but the time passed with necessary arrangements in
reference to the ship and also in talking to the natives of
Nacquebar. At last, at 4 o'clock the captain ordered the boat
to be put out, and I set out for the shore, feeling very glad
and happy. But on nearing the land we perceived a strong
breaking of the waves against the shore. We chose a little
bay, which seemed to have sandy banks, because it was guarded
on both sides by high cliffs. A big wave seized the boat and
threw it with great violence against the shore; a second bigger
wave followed, which filled the boat, broke one of the oars,
and some parts of the boat itself, besides terrifying us greatly.
I did not want to wait for the third wave to come, but jumped
down into the water, which reached up to my waist, in order
to escape a greater danger, and all I had taken with me was
soaked.</p>

<p>"The shore was rather steep in the beginning, and there
were many little bays, covered with a whitish-yellow sand.
The above-mentioned stone cliffs consisted of grey coarse
chalkstone. Here and there big pieces of different kinds of
corals had been thrown up by the sea, among them one kind
which had the appearance of many knife-blades grown together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
I do not remember having seen any of this kind before. Higher
up on the shore there were innumerable varieties of blue, black,
red, brown, and white corals, among them also the so-called
'red organ.' I also found a peculiar kind of very coarse
sponge, and many kinds of shells were thrown up very high;
many of them had been thrown into the woods for some little
distance. The whole shore was not of a man's height, and it
almost immediately sloped down again towards the wood....</p>

<p>"... As it grew dark I went to one of the hamlets where
about twenty houses, most of them with pointed thatched roofs,
stood on piles. The principal houses, three in number, were
placed in the middle, but each separate from the other. They
were built on piles about 10 to 12 inches thick, and more than
a man's height. Some of them had 24 to 30 of these piles;
they were bamboo, and one side was open, where a bench hung
by ropes, large enough to allow two people to sit upon, and
so low, that their feet when sitting would touch the ground.
The roof of the real dwelling-house was in some cases angularly
pointed, in others rounder; very few showed a long ridge. The
access was gained by means of a narrow well-made bamboo
ladder, through a square hole, which was wide enough to afford
admission for a full-grown man; the floor consisted of broad
sawn planks of unequal length supported by the cross beams;
these beams in their turn resting on the above-mentioned piles.
The big houses were divided into storeys, the lower one being
as high as two men, the upper one was lower and more like
a barn.</p>

<p>"Round about on the principal rafters, there were some
bamboo sticks hardly as thick as the thumb fastened across.
This looked very nice; but there were no windows at all, nor
any to replace them, but the light came only through the holes
serving them for door, therefore it was very dark. All their
household implements were standing round about, mostly tied
to the bamboo; that which could not be kept in this manner
had been put into small boxes, which were one foot long, half
a foot wide, and hardly half a foot high, and were provided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
with lids, which were made, as I have already said before,
from the partitions sheaths of the young cham&#339;rops leaves.
These little boxes had been tied to a bamboo, which was
fastened right across the room, and was therefore at some
distance from the roof.</p>

<p>"There was great cleanliness as regards the floor, and the
air also was very pure, not the faintest disagreeable odour
could be detected. The upper storey consisted only of bamboo
sticks, they were thin, not tied together, and resting on the
cross beams; they had turned somewhat brown through the
smoke of the lamps, but I could not see that they kept any
provisions there, and on the whole they do not collect many
provisions. I saw some piles erected near some of the houses,
they were more than man's height, two cross piles were
fastened to them, and here they stewed some yam roots in
the open air. They had no gardens, their houses and also
their outhouses stood among <i>Carica papaya</i>. Their weapons
consisted of small lances somewhat shaped like pikes, which
were made of smooth round sticks about as thick as a finger
and three yards long.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> I saw some of them return with
these kind of weapons. They had been in the wood to fetch
provisions for one or two days. I did not see any fishing
implements.</p>

<p>"There were two ships there, one of them an English three-master,
the second one lying further south with two masts,
it was a French ship. They were both loading coconuts,
which they bought here very cheaply in order to take them to
Pegu, and to sell them there with great profit.</p>

<p>"Their women have almost the same appearance as their men,
being strong and muscular, but most of them had their hair
shorn off. Their clothing consisted of a blue cloth wound round
their loins, or they wore an apron made of leaves, which was
cut in strips hardly one line wide, and reached down to the
knees; they were plaited together at the top and hung round
their bodies in layers almost two inches thick. These strips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
seemed to have been taken from the borassi or cham&#339;rops.
Some grown-up girls I saw here as well, their hair was cut off
below the ear and hung loosely round their head.</p>

<p>"However many people I saw here of different sex, I did
not come across any whom I could have termed old. The
only exception was a woman, apparently about fifty years old.
The shortness of my stay here prevented me to make further
researches and inquiries, which besides would have been very
difficult considering the language and utter simplicity of the
natives. As far as I could observe they were very vague in
their ideas as regards years, months, weeks, days, and hours.</p>

<p>"Near one of the large houses I saw some piles; they were
about ten inches thick, square, and two and a half feet high.
At the upper end they had two holes, meeting in the middle
like a cross; through them were plaited many coloured ribbons
both of linen and of cloth, presenting the appearance of streamers;
at their end there was a stick about as high as a man, at the
end of this a piece of white linen was fastened of about two
inches wide, looking like a flag; all this was surrounded by a
sort of conical figure of the sheaths of the cham&#339;rops, so that
only in front a little piece of the streamers was to be seen. I
made inquiries as to these things, and they told me they were
monuments for the dead, and that lately three persons had died
in this house. I saw some more of the same kind of stakes
which were already old, but there was not one near every
house.</p>

<p>"I saw some persons of both sexes wearing green fringes,
and I inquired why they were in this manner distinguished
from the others; as much as I could learn from my interpreter
these were those who had held their feast of love. This is
always celebrated in the woods, never anywhere else, and as a
sign of this joy they wore these fringes; they were really made
from long pisang<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> leaves split through the middle and fringed
crossways. They are first worn round their neck, then across
their shoulders, and at last round their loins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>"My attention was attracted by a continual murmuring; I
inquired into its cause. It was the singing of some women,
who wanted to cure another of her headache. This afforded
me at the same time the opportunity of seeing the interior of
their houses. I was admitted and allowed to mount, and I
found the invalid sitting on her feet, some of the women lying
near her, and four standing before her; one of them held something
in her hand, which was supposed to be some article for
fumigating; I could, however, neither see nor smell it. Their
whole song consisted of one tone, which was taken first at a
very high pitch, but by repeating it so often they slowly sank
to the lowest notes, then they paused, and one of them commenced
again very high, and the others chimed in until they
had again arrived at the lowest notes. They kept on singing
in this way as long as I was there, which, however, was not
very long, because it soon grew dark. I felt the invalid's
forehead, which was a little warmer than ordinarily and covered
with weak perspiration. Her hands were also hot, and her
pulse quicker than usual, which symptoms might point to a
cold in a body inclined to laziness.</p>

<p>"The number of children that I met here was not large
either, and was far smaller than what I had seen on the coast
in villages of equal size. I saw very few animals here; they
kept some pigs near their houses, and the pork is said to be
of very good taste here, because they feed the pigs on coconuts.
There were also some small hens here, and a female dog, very
much like the pariah dogs, which I had seen on the coast, and
probably it was brought from there, only it seemed to have
shorter legs than the ordinary kind....</p>

<p>"... As it grew dark I left the country, where I should have
liked to stay for some days, but I feared we might not get
safely through the high waves. A <i>cicada</i> sang in the wood in
a strange manner&mdash;for me it was a sad song. In the dark
evening I picked up a little piece of seaweed which had been
thrown on shore. We were luckier than we had feared to be
as regards the starting from shore, which we left after having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
explored the country for one hour and a half. After one hour's
journey both ways, we arrived on board at 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>"<i>September 1st.</i>&mdash;Early this morning the anchors were
hoisted, but hardly had we left the land when a storm, combined
with heavy showers of rain, arose. The atmosphere was misty,
and one of these stormy showers was so violent and sudden
that we almost perished. A new top-sail was torn to pieces,
the waves at the same time were uncommonly high, and the
whole sea like in a thunderstorm. I thanked God that I succeeded
in arranging the specimens which I had gathered on
my journey."</p>

<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the Kar Nicobarese there are far more customs and
ceremonies than I could ascertain during a short visit, but in the
following pages an attempt has been made to chronicle all those
that came to my knowledge. Many of them were elicited by
questioning Mr V. Solomon, the Government Agent on the
island, but still more are extracted from his diaries as printed in
the Supplements of the <i>Andaman and Nicobar Gazette</i>. For the
accuracy, therefore, of much of this chapter, Mr Solomon is
responsible.</p>

<p>Of all the observances, customs, and ceremonies of Nicobarese
life, that of <i>Kana Awn</i>, where the bones of the dead are exhumed,
is perhaps the most important. Literally it is called <i>Ka-al-awn</i>&mdash;feast
of pigs' flesh.</p>

<p>It is a very laborious and costly festival, commemorated every
third or fourth year, with much ceremony commingled of joy and
sorrow.</p>

<p>All the islanders cannot observe it at one limited period, nor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
can the people of one whole village do so conjointly with each
other. If a few families of a village commemorate the feast during
one year, other families will undertake it at some other convenient
year, which will be at a time when their stores are abundant, and
after sufficient delay for the bones of their deceased to become
denuded of flesh.</p>

<p>The festival is conducted with much expenditure and demonstration,
and differs slightly in each village.</p>

<p>It consists of a course of ceremonies continuing from one full
moon to another, and commences as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>About ten months prior to the occasion, all the people of a
village consult together to fix the festival month, and then inform
the rest of the villages, and obtain their promise of assistance.
They next send messengers to give notice to all the villages of the
island of their intentions, and bear preliminary invitations (<i>mahau-kar&eacute;</i>).
Of these there are two kinds&mdash;general and special. The
general invitation is given to friends and relatives, that they may
join them in the feast and help in various respects. The special
invitation is sent by one family of the commemorators of the
ceremony to the people of a whole village, that the hosts may give
a performance in their house on the occasion. If ten families of
a village commemorate the feast, they would invite the people
of ten distant villages for this purpose, while those of three
adjacent villages would be invited generally.</p>

<p>Their first duty, after sending out invitations, is to make a <i>&ntilde;&aacute;-kop&aacute;h</i>
(feast for the dead). Some well-carved wooden poles,
fifty or sixty feet in height, with cross battens, are prepared and
planted in the ground at <i>Elpanam</i>, and in the village in front of
the houses of the commemorators. On these the people hang up
varieties of yams and plantains; bundles of sireh leaf; bunches
of coconuts, areca-nuts, pandanus, fruit, cheroots, and other
eatables to which they are accustomed; in all, about fifty kinds.
Below the posts they place teakwood boxes containing new clothes
and jewels; bottles of toddy and earthen pots from Chaura, all
fenced in carefully. These arrangements are decorated from top
to bottom with flags, etc., until they look like Indian processional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
cars. This work is the occupation of about thirty men for three
months. From the day the <i>&ntilde;&aacute;-kop&aacute;h</i> is commenced, the natives
are restricted from killing pigs in the village.</p>

<p>On these occasions they take great pains in repairing their
cooking huts, erecting new ones, and in making new roads and
paths up to the boundaries of their village in every direction.
The open ground at <i>Elpanam</i> and the graveyard are also
cleared and kept tidy, and in the meanwhile they make every
effort to secure sufficient quantities of provisions for the festival.
A month before this begins some more <i>&ntilde;&aacute;-kop&aacute;hs</i>, similar to
the above, are prepared with fresh eatables, which, however,
are not set out until a week before the feast. When this
is done, final invitations (<i>mi-nga-la</i>) are sent to all the
guests.</p>

<p>Besides this, a week before the opening day <i>kare-yeng-ch&oacute;n</i>
(headstones of graves) are made in the following manner:&mdash;A
well-shaped, round log of wood, about 3 feet long and 9 inches
in diameter, having two through holes crossing each other near
one end, is prepared and kept in readiness. At the approach
of the feast a number of men and women together adorn it by
rolling round it a piece of white calico and fringing it with
red or blue cloth. Four large soup-ladles are fastened to the
holes and to the middle of the log, a cross-shaped iron pike,
about 6 feet long, called <i>mer&aacute;hta</i>, ornamented with many spoons,
forks and soup-ladles,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> is fixed. To it also are attached toys,
dolls, and fancy weapons, with other curiosities, which all add to
the gorgeous appearance of the object. Some families keep
this in the newly-erected cookhouse, others in the open yard.
They particularly take the guests and friends to see it in order
to show that they are wealthy.</p>

<p>The men then construct, for temporary use, two or three
long bamboo cages, with separate enclosures, so that a dozen
pigs may be put in each cage. One is built underneath, and
the others in front of the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the canoes are decorated, filled with many kinds
of provisions, and drawn up in front of the houses.</p>

<p>All this is done with the help of friends from neighbouring
villages, who, neglecting their own affairs, willingly come and
assist, even bringing with them food sufficient for their needs
until the close of the festival.</p>

<p>After all these preparations are completed, there commences
the preliminary ceremony called <i>Vani pati</i> (house decoration),
which takes place a day before the festival. The interiors of
the houses are decorated profusely with coco-palm leaves, goian
(Arum) plants, and flags. Bunches of tender coconuts, areca-nuts
and plantains are tied all about the posts of the house outside, that
the guests may partake at pleasure. Several pieces of chintz,
red cloth, and calico are hung from strings in the interior, and
beneath the house as well, and the <i>mer&aacute;hta</i>, with the ornamented
canoes, are placed on either side of the <i>&ntilde;&aacute;-kop&aacute;h</i>. The
bamboo pig-pens are also decorated, and when all this is completed
they kill a pig, sprinkle the blood over all as a sacrifice, and
dance and sing around the house, with their guests, for the first time.</p>

<p>Now comes the first act. On the festival evening the people
bring, with songs, numbers of pigs from their jungle piggeries,
and placing them in the cages, dance before them. Those
animals put in the cage beneath the house are merely for
exhibition, as a proof of wealth, though, at the same time, they
are dedicated to a future festival. In the cages outside are left
those pigs that are to be slaughtered for the present occasion,
and there is yet another cage in which are confined those brought
to them by their friends as a festive gift.</p>

<p><i>Kiriam Hetpat</i> (dancing in bright light) is the second and
chief festival. By eight or nine in the evening, the village is
filled with almost the whole of the islanders; a group of one
village in one house. The special and general guests assemble
in gangs in their respective quarters.</p>

<p>The men are adorned with new loin-cloths of various kinds
and colours, with the <i>t&aacute;-ch&ouml;kla</i>, or chaplet, and <i>tasses</i>&mdash;necklaces
made of silver coins.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>The women wear necklaces, "ear-distenders," bangles&mdash;made
by twisting silver wire round arm and leg&mdash;and strings of silver
coins as head ornaments. A pair of red Madras handkerchiefs,
or two yards of red cloth and two of Chinese blue, stitched
together, are worn as the principal garment.</p>

<p>Some come already dressed, others bring their attire with
them, and don it on the spot.</p>

<p>The special guests bring ten or a dozen pigs of moderate
size, as presents to those by whom they are invited. (Here it
may be said that the people, although well acquainted in
general, never call each other friends promiscuously. Whoever
contributes a gift during this festival to another, is alone his true
friend. There is a regular agreement about this, and special
invitations for any occasion are only given by turns.) The
women bring with them baskets of prepared food&mdash;pandanus
bread, boiled yams, rice&mdash;and with this, and with pork presented
by the hosts, they refresh themselves during the night.</p>

<p>Dancing and singing then take place. The men give their
performance first, and when they are fatigued, they make way
for the women, and so it goes on, turn and turn about. The
former in their dance go through various motions of sitting,
rising, bending, and jumping, but the women only attempt a
series of steps.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> This proceeding continues in the compound of
each festival party throughout the night.</p>

<p>In the morning, while dancing still continues, there are
brought forward some strong wooden cages, about 4 feet long
and 3 feet in height and breadth&mdash;some in shape like a palanquin,
and some dome-shaped like the houses. These cages are gaily
decorated with flags, chintz, and gilt jewellery. On the top of
each a platform with curtains is prepared, and on either side
stout bamboo poles are fastened. A huge long-tusked boar
adorned with jewellery is placed in each cage, and a man, woman,
and boy, seat themselves on the platform with a quantity of
plantains and betel-nut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>When everything is ready, new red loin-cloth and <i>t&aacute;-ch&ouml;klas</i>
are supplied to the guests. Then the cages, with the pigs inside,
and with the people upon them, are carried round from house
to house in a procession, with singing and dancing, each borne
by about forty men or women. Those who are not able to
construct a cage, carry, as a substitute, long bamboos, across
which the pig, with bound legs, is fastened. As they proceed,
betel-nuts and plantains are distributed by those on the cages.
In this way they march round the village, and return to the
starting-point, <i>vi&acirc; Elpanam</i>, the teams of women as they stagger
along with their heavy burden giving rise to much amusement.</p>

<p>When the procession is over the natives release the pigs in
the cars, as well as nearly all the others, detaining only those
that are to be slaughtered on that day for the guests. Then
after felling the poles of the <i>&ntilde;&aacute;-kop&aacute;h</i> by cutting them with
an axe, 6 feet above the ground, they scatter the food in the
jungle and fence the site. The canoes and other articles are
broken to pieces and thrown away, and only the <i>mer&aacute;hta</i>, or
iron pike, is preserved, with its decorations, to be made use of
later.</p>

<p>Next comes <i>Henghawa</i>, meaning "In return." A dozen or
more pigs of ordinary size are distributed by the inviting party to
the group of performers. These may kill and eat them on the
spot, or take them away to their homes. This present is made
in place of giving a feast. The dancing party who receive it
would, according to their own numbers, kill a few of the pigs,
cut them into pieces, and distribute the flesh among the
families of their group. They roast the pieces, eat as much
as they like, and take the remaining portions away with them.
The pigs that are not killed will also be taken to their village,
and will be there reserved for some public occasion. As a rule,
the people who receive the present must be ready to give
away a similar one in their turn when the same festival occurs
in their village.</p>

<p>The spectacle of these people as they depart, men, women,
young and old, each with a load of roasted pork either fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
to long sticks, strung on cords, or packed in baskets, affords
further amusement.</p>

<p>The general guests&mdash;the people of the nearest villages&mdash;will
remain till the close of the feast to assist the hosts, and
to give further performances of dancing and singing every night.
They take their share of the food with the commemorators.</p>

<p>With their help the amusements are renewed, and on the
following morning the big pigs, which were carried in procession,
are slaughtered and cut into long strips, some of which,
generally the spinal portions, are suspended at the entrance of
the houses, as offerings to the evil spirits, and are there allowed
to remain until the next celebration of <i>Kana-Awn</i>. Several
pieces will also be distributed to friends and relatives.</p>

<p>Before these pigs are killed it is customary for young men
to wrestle with them, and many of them are often so severely
gored by the long tusks of the animals that they have to be
carried away in litters.</p>

<p>This portion of the festival is called <i>Yeng Awn</i>&mdash;the great
boar&mdash;for each of the animals which are dedicated to the
purpose is looked on as a sacred creature, and is offered as a
sacrifice in token of the last head of the family who died.</p>

<p>From the remaining portions of pork they separate the fatty
part and prepare lard from it by pounding it in a wooden mortar
and boiling it down in an earthen vessel. This lard is preserved
in coconut shells and eaten with meals like butter. A few shellsfull
are presented to those of their friends who have assisted
them. This portion of the ceremony is called <i>Wanaka Kuv</i>
(making lard), and with the immediately preceding stage lasts
for four or five days. Then commences the ceremony of <i>Kisu ta
el pati</i>, during which all the decorations of the houses are removed,
and dancing and singing take place inside. This is done in order
to purify the house.</p>

<p>Next, the practice of <i>Tanang alah</i> (prevention) takes place;
and throughout the day the people busy themselves covering
the houses and huts in <i>Elpanam</i> with green coco-palm leaves, to
prevent pollution by the disinterred bones of next day's proceed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>ings.
They take their supper in <i>Elpanam</i>, and dance there all
night.</p>

<p>At this point, the climax of the whole is reached in <i>An&uacute;la
Kop&aacute;h</i>, or <i>Ula Kop&aacute;h</i> (digging the graves). The women, children,
and others stand at a distance from the graveyard, and one or
two of the adults belonging to each of the houses commemorating,
open the respective graves, remove the bones, and throw
them in an adjoining bush called <i>Tam n'gi Kop&aacute;h</i><a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>&mdash;burial-place
of bones (ossuary). But they replace in the graves the skulls of
respected people or heads of families, and after refilling the holes
with earth, place over them the new <i>kuimitila</i> or <i>kare-yeng-ch&oacute;n</i>
(headstones). Before the skulls are replaced, however, they are
sprinkled with the blood of fowls and young pigs.</p>

<p>The men who break open the graves are termed <i>takkuwi</i>
(polluted) and when all is over they bathe in the sea, and then
spend the night in the "house of pollution," after a period of
feasting and dance in the <i>Elpanam</i>, called <i>Kiriam An&uacute;la</i> (digging
dance).</p>

<p>Two or three days later the coco-palm leaves are removed
from the houses at <i>Elpanam</i>, and another performance is held
called <i>Kiriam-nga-rit-roi-ta-oka</i> (dance for clearing up coconut
rubbish). Next morning sports and a little wrestling take
place.</p>

<p>Finally, the people invite some of the <i>mafais</i> of adjacent
villages to give a performance, and entertain them with gifts
and feasting. This ceremony is called <i>Afai tapoia</i>, or <i>Mafai
tapira</i>&mdash;grand <i>mafai</i> dance. When it is concluded some other
village is challenged to a canoe race, and a dance and feast
follow. With this ends the festival of <i>Kana Awn</i>.</p>

<p>When everything is over they carefully gather together the
jawbones of the pigs that have been killed in every house,
fasten them to a long rattan, and hang them up in the public
building at <i>Elpanam</i>. In this way a comparison is made between
past and present wealth, and proof is afforded of the splendour of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
a ceremony that impoverishes many of the hosts for years to
come.</p>

<p>The following is an account of the ceremony of <i>An&uacute;la</i>, or
<i>Ula Kop&aacute;h</i>, as it was actually carried out in the village of
Lap&aacute;ti on the east coast of Kar Nicobar. It was preceded by
the usual festival of <i>Kana Awn</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i>takkuwis</i> (polluted ones) who were engaged in digging
the graves, the men wore white loin cloths and the women petticoats
of a similar colour. The graveyard was thickly screened by
coco-palm leaves.</p>

<p>All the big houses in <i>Elpanam</i>, and the cooking huts in the
village, were so thickly covered with leaves that no breeze could
penetrate. A wall of palm leaves and four temporary huts were
erected in each corner, that the <i>takkuwis</i> might take refreshment.
Several pieces of white calico and Turkey red cloth were kept
in these houses for wrapping up the bones. Those graves to
be left untouched were covered with white cloth and neatly
decorated.</p>

<p>Whilst each grave was being opened one of the <i>tamiluanas</i>
stood at the head and fanned it with a bunch of "devil-expelling"
leaves, and another man kept in readiness a palm-spathe and piece
of white calico. When the grave-digger took out the skull it was
cleaned by hand, carefully rolled in the calico, and placed in the
spathe; all the other bones were then collected in the same spathe,
which was taken away and placed over large yams scattered below
the "deadhouse," where it was wrapped and bound with red and
white calico. About fifty graves were opened, and the bones
similarly treated. A few bundles were reinterred, but the others
were taken away to a place called <i>Kofent&eacute;</i> (place of pollution),
where they were opened, the bones thrown away and the cloth
torn to rags.</p>

<p>After this the grave-diggers went to the sea and washed their
hands and legs, and a few bathed entirely.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The following is an account of the observance of <i>Katap-hang</i>,
or lighting the <i>Elpanam</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>For several days a number of young men and women are
engaged in cleaning out <i>Elpanam</i>. During this process they
are not allowed to touch eatables meant for others, nor may
they enter the village, as they are considered polluted while at
work. When it is over the women collect all the coconut husks
they can obtain, and arrange them in lines about the <i>Elpanam</i>
and round the houses in it.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>The nuts are set fire to after sunset, and the people pass the
night in singing and dancing, in several groups, lighted by the
fires. Whenever they feel tired they eat, the proper food for the
occasion being land-crabs, which have been collected during the
previous week.</p>

<p>A spittoon of palm leaf is placed in the centre of each group,
and into it go all the cheroot ends and betel-nut quids, to prevent
pollution of the ground of <i>Elpanam</i>, which is now purified and fit
for the habitation of spirits.</p>

<p>During the dancing the men cover their loins with a wrapping
of plantain leaf, which makes them look like women. The women
run about all night keeping the coconut shells alight.</p>

<p>About five o'clock in the morning the performance comes
to an end, and then a number of women sweep out <i>Elpanam</i>,
collecting the ashes and other rubbish, which are thrown into
the sea. The men, with much excitement, take the outriggers
from the canoes, and placing some of these under the <i>Elpanam</i>
houses, bear others to the village, covering all with palm leaves.
All portable property, pots, etc., is taken out of the houses in
<i>Elpanam</i>, and, closing the doors, the people march away to the
village (only the sick and one or two attendants, and those who
dug the last grave, are left behind).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>Silence has now to be observed for a month; no fire or light
may be seen, and no cheroot smoked in the place: women and
children are interdicted from entering, but should they be compelled
to do so, they must make no noise, and if at night, must
leave their light at the entrance.</p>

<p>The people can give no account of the origin of this
observance. Some allude to "custom," and others say that it
is because so many spirits visit the place at this season.</p>

<p>Thirty days after the festival concludes, a great feast is given
to the spirits, and they are sent back to the jungle.</p>

<p>Canoes are kept beneath the houses for several months,
until the festival of <i>Kiala</i>, or fetching food, when they are brought
to the beach at <i>Elpanam</i>, caulked, and made ready for use.</p>

<p>On the day of <i>Kiala</i> the men are out all day, with hook
and line, fishing. When they return in the evening with their
catch, each immediately offers as a sacrifice to the canoe a
mixture of chopped fish and other materials, which are made
into a paste and applied to the vessel. The fish they have
caught are skewered on bamboo and roasted. Those unable
to go during the day set out at night with torches prepared for
the occasion.</p>

<p>Next day is <i>Anoi-ila</i>, a holiday, and in the morning all
assemble in the houses at <i>Elpanam</i> and partake collectively
of the roasted fish with other things. Then they sleep till
evening, and do no work.</p>

<p>A day following closely is called <i>Enwan-n'gi</i> (fishing again
for the children). As a rule, the fish caught on the first expedition
is all consumed at the general banquet, but this is taken
to the houses and eaten there. A holiday again follows.</p>

<p>To attract fish to their shores it is customary for the villages
to erect on the beach at <i>Elpanam</i>, when the sea is calm, a
number of long bamboos decorated with leaves, etc. This
practice is called <i>Ma-ya-kuv-ka-ma-ka</i>&mdash;Papa is going this way
to fetch fish. The poles remain for four days, and after they
are removed, the large canoes obtained at Chaura are fed (<i>Ngya
&aacute;p</i>), and fowls are offered to them in sacrifice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Sacrifice is generally offered to these canoes thrice in each
month&mdash;on seeing the new moon, at full moon, and on the
waning of the moon.</p>

<p>A ceremony called <i>Ramal</i> is held in honour of the safe
return of the canoes that periodically make the customary
voyages to Chaura for pottery. It consists of feasting, dancing,
and singing, as do most of the Nicobarese observances. These
songs and dances are composed some time before the events
and carefully practised during the interval.</p>

<p>The ceremony of <i>Gnunota</i> is held on behalf of those drowned
during this annual voyage to Chaura, and is practised, instead of
burial and the ceremony of <i>Kana Awn</i>, on occasions when the
bodies are not available.</p>

<p>The death of a Nicobarese when absent is regarded with
much greater concern than when such an event takes place at
home. This is quite in accordance with European feeling.</p>

<p>A belief that the Chaura men are great exponents of
<i>wizardry</i> is deeply rooted throughout the group. One of the
M&#363;s canoes having been lost on the return from that island,
the <i>tamiluanas</i> told the people that the Chaura men had a
grudge against the people of M&#363;s, which, however, they did not
like to satisfy in the island, but caused the visitors to be
destroyed while at sea, by means of the black art, through which
a tempest was raised during their return voyage.</p>

<p>The <i>tamiluanas</i> possess the power of conversing with the
spirits of the dead, and they informed the village that they had
seen this deceased party, who stated that they had perished
from hunger, and now wanted meals.</p>

<p>M&#363;s, therefore, was ordered to offer sacrifice, and accordingly
the people contributed spoons, forks, clothes, and silver wire,
besides killing pigs and preparing meals in each house.</p>

<p>After the sacrifice (<i>Gnunota</i>) had been made the <i>tamiluanas</i>
gave out that all the souls were satisfied with the meals and
other things, but that "Davy Jones," the leader of the unfortunate
party, was displeased with the offering!</p>

<p>Feasts are partaken of, and sacrifices made in the grave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>yard,
in honour of deceased ancestors, whose spirits sometimes
reveal themselves to the <i>tamiluanas</i>. These occasions are called
<i>Ma-la-hal</i>.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>A series of festivals indulged in begins with a day called <i>Kewi-apa</i>.
On this day, the people of M&#363;s clear a portion of the jungle
in the interior, and decorate the spot with palm leaves, bringing
from it <i>S&iacute;ya</i>&mdash;the devil&mdash;to <i>Elpanam</i>. All the houses at <i>Elpanam</i>,
and the space there, are decorated. The people of Arong (a
neighbouring village) and M&#363;s then go there and take part in
a performance lasting all night, for which they have practised
during the past month. Other villages come as spectators and
guests. The next morning there is a feast, at which special
materials are pigs and jungle crabs. When it is over, a wrestling
match closes the ceremony.</p>

<p>On the third and following days, all the people, and those of
the neighbouring villages, are engaged in preparing for the feast
of <i>Kial</i>, to which many villages come as guests.</p>

<p>The day preceding the feast of <i>Kial</i> is called <i>Mu-nung-ren</i>, or
"day of preparation." Poles are brought from the jungle, tied
round the houses at <i>Elpanam</i>, and covered with tender palm
leaves, while new cooking places are prepared below each house.
The interior of the houses and the compounds are decorated.
From sunrise till dark the women are busy preparing <i>kusuhu</i>,
a confection of yams, green and ripe plantains, coconut, and oil;
and meanwhile, the men sing songs in honour of the large
canoes, which, kept for the past month in the interior, are brought
to <i>Elpanam</i>, immersed in the sea, and decorated.</p>

<p>Next day is the day of <i>Kial</i>, or "taking food." From morning
till night the people are engaged in feasting their guests, in
dining together in groups, and in sending to their friends and
neighbours <i>kusuhu</i>, pork and fowls.</p>

<p>At midday a cry of supplication is heard from each building&mdash;"Let
our house be always supplied with abundance of food; let
us have many edible gifts from other villages; let there come
new women to our village; let us be happy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>This day is one of much rejoicing, for the natives consider
the <i>kusuhu</i> one of their greatest delicacies.</p>

<p>Next day is called <i>Anoi-ila</i>&mdash;day of rest for the people.</p>

<p>Then, the eighth after <i>Kewi-apa</i>, comes the day <i>Ha-chu</i>, on
which they take back the devil to the jungle with more ceremony.
Having returned from this, they engage in a hunt, with the aid
of dogs, for jungle pigs.</p>

<p>The day following is <i>Anoi-ila</i>; on the next, a second pig hunt
takes place; and finally, one more "day of rest" ends the festival.</p></div>

<p><i>Maya</i>, or <i>Vani-el-kui</i>, means "top decoration," and for this, long
green bamboos are brought from the jungle and encircled with
leaves from top to bottom. They are then fixed round the graveyard
at <i>Elpanam</i>, to the accompaniment of ceremonies led by
the <i>tamiluanas</i>, with spirit exorcising paraphernalia.</p>

<p>During the three days following, the people prepare two large
rafts, of canoe shape, and equip them with sails of palm
leaf, dry palm leaf torches, and bunches of "devil-expelling"
leaves. This work is done by the young men and women, the
<i>tamiluanas</i> and other elderly people being engaged, meanwhile,
in singing by turns, through night and day, in one of the houses
at <i>Elpanam</i>. The <i>tamiluanas</i> frequently come down and walk
along the beach with their exorcising rods, and forbid the devil
to enter the village.</p>

<p>The fourth day is called <i>Yintovna S&iacute;ya</i>&mdash;expelling the devil
by sails. In the evening, the whole of the village assembles at
<i>Elpanam</i> with bunches of "devil-expelling" leaves, the women
with baskets of ashes in addition.</p>

<p>A number of men, with an escort of <i>tamiluanas</i>, carry one of
the floats to the sea, on the right side of the cemetery, and propel
it some distance from the shore; when they return, another body
of men despatches the other craft from the left side of the graveyard.
The bearers, on reaching shore, are supplied with bundles
of leaves, and as soon as the vessels reach deep water, the women
throw ashes from the shore, and the whole crowd shouts, "Fly
away, devil, fly away, never come again." Then all the decorated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
bamboos are removed, one after another, and all the leaves thrown
into the sea; from each bamboo, as it is taken down, the devil is
expelled.</p>

<p>Should the canoes sail off toward Chaura, much rejoicing is
occasioned. One seems to contain an evil, the other a benignant
spirit. The latter may possibly return and inform the <i>tamiluanas</i>
that the devil has reached Chaura, and in token of this, there
will be found near the graveyard a new Chaura pot, a chicken,
a paddle, or similar objects.</p>

<p>If this occurs, there is a day of rejoicing, called <i>Amhai</i>, when
pigs and fowls are offered as a sacrifice to the conquering spirit,
and a grand feast and dance take place at night.</p>

<p>This is an annual ceremony, commemorated in turn by all
the village, but unfortunately, as with their other customs and
ceremonies, the islanders, whose knowledge of their origin is
limited, can give no clear reason for its inception, although there
must be a perfectly adequate one, and state only that they do
it because it is "custom."</p>

<p>Festivals called <i>Maya</i> and <i>Inturga</i> are also commemorated
to drive the jungle devils into the sea.</p>

<p>One of the most effectual means of <i>exorcising devils</i> is by
fanning with leaves. The M&#363;s racing canoe, having returned
to the village soon after a death had taken place there, was
not received in the usual manner. Two elderly men who were
on the beach, waiting, ran down before the canoe could touch
the shore, and hurriedly brushed it, and the men in it, with
brooms. They then brought the canoe ashore, and fanned it
with coco-palm leaves, so that the dead man's ghost might not
take possession.</p>

<p>When the north-east monsoon sets in, the sea is very rough
on the east coast, and many people become seriously ill, the
result being that there are always a greater number of deaths
than usual in that part of the island.</p>

<p>All the villages there situated accordingly take in hand the
process of <i>Tanangla</i>, which signifies "support" or "prevention."</p>

<p>In this, they fence <i>Elpanam</i> with palm leaves, and festoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
the houses and pathways with various kinds of shrubs and grasses.
They also prepare huge images in human form, by twisting palm
leaves round logs of wood, and place these about their houses.</p>

<p>An old man lost his teeth, and to celebrate the fact, gave
a great feast to a large body of people who came to it from
other villages. The giver was adorned with silver wire from
head to foot, and made to sit in a <i>kant&eacute;ra</i> (<i>mafai's</i> chair) in
honour of his departed grinders.</p>

<p>A man was bitten by a snake, with serious consequences.
When he recovered, he invited his friends to a feast, and
performed the ceremony of <i>Ke luing alaa</i>, which consisted in
waving a lighted palm-leaf torch round his head.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The natives apparently possess the right to assume various
social distinctions at will.</p>

<p>There is a class of men termed <i>Sanokuv</i> which numbers
many individuals in its ranks. <i>Sanokuv</i> seems to mean a
bashful or delicate person.</p>

<p>These men will not eat any food cooked by others, neither
will they use well-water, nor partake of pigs and chickens reared
in the village, as they consider these unclean. The water they
require they obtain either from a jungle stream, or by collecting
rain. They will not drink toddy made from trees near the
village, but draw it from distant palms. Everything is partaken
of from special vessels; toddy is sucked from a bamboo through
a reed, of which the mouth-end is capped with a larger as soon
as the drink is finished. They are, however, willing to accept
bread, biscuits, and rum from others, but the latter is drunk
from a new coconut shell, and never from a glass.</p>

<p>The whole proceeding seems to be a variant of the Hindu
institution of <i>caste</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Mafai</i> is another peculiarity of the Nicobar social organisation.</p>

<p>The Kar Nicobarese take great interest in the creation of
<i>mafais</i>, and in conducting <i>mafai</i> performances. They give much
of their property, time, and labour to a <i>mafai</i>, and look on him as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
somewhat sacred. He is a man who, recovering from a serious
illness, decides to do no work for some time to come; in fact,
he continues to be an invalid, and henceforth neither obtains
nor cooks food, but is supported by the community.</p>

<p>The word <i>mah</i> means "sir," and is used to indicate one who
is a superior, and is employed as a term of respect towards men
and women of some age: the chief of a village, the head of a
family, or parents, are styled <i>mah</i>. <i>Fai</i> means "inspired." <i>Mafai</i>
therefore means "an inspired man," <i>i.e.</i>, a seer.</p>

<p>A person may at the first stage of his recovery from a severe
and long-standing illness, or an attack of delirium, inform his
relatives that he has received a revelation, and therefore desires
to become a <i>mafai</i>. This is communicated to the <i>tamiluanas</i>,
and they, as well as other elderly people of the village, assemble
in his house, and after making a formal examination, pronounce
the verdict, <i>tafuknu chuat</i>&mdash;"sunken eyes."</p>

<p>A preliminary ceremony is then performed, called <i>Hanata</i>&mdash;"adorning
the invalid." They spread round his couch "devil-expelling"
leaves from <i>Mal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> and decorate the cane wall of the
house, at his side, with festoons, tassels, beads, wire, garlands, etc.,
placing near him spoons, forks, and other electro-plated ware, with
a few bottles of toddy.</p>

<p>They twist silver wire about his neck, arms, and legs, and
adorn him with necklaces, tassels, breastplate, and armlets, made
of silver coins, and then place him in a large decorated chair with
a Chinese straw hat on his head. A silver-handled stick (sceptre
of the <i>tamiluana</i>) and a small dagger to kill the devil are given
him, together with a bottle of toddy, furnished with a hollow reed
to suck the liquid through.</p>

<p>He is now proclaimed a <i>mafai</i>, and information is sent to his
friends and relatives in other villages, who all come with presents
to see the holy man.</p>

<p>From this time forward, until he is thoroughly recovered, the
people of his village, with other friends and relatives, provide his
food and other necessaries by turns. This they do on a liberal scale.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a performance every night in the village, lasting
till midnight, during which he sits on a chair in the midst of the
ring of dancers, whom sometimes he may join. This exercise
is to increase his strength, and he is freely supplied with toddy,
as it is considered a tonic.</p>

<p>From time to time his neighbours take him, sometimes spontaneously
and sometimes by invitation, from house to house and
village to village, in procession, and give performances. <i>Ai-yu-a-kare</i>
is one of these, and means "going to a feast adorned with
jewels."</p>

<p>He never walks, but is always carried in a <i>kant&eacute;ra</i> (chair),
which in shape resembles a palanquin, covered with chintz and
decorated with spoons, forks, and soup-ladles. The chair is borne
by a dozen strong men. The spectacle of a returning <i>mafai</i> and
his party is extremely comical, for, besides being fatigued by the
night's exertions, every one is completely intoxicated.</p>

<p>The people venerate the <i>mafai</i> exceedingly, and take him at
midnight to the sick, that he may heal them by touch or by shampooing,
when he pretends to extract gravel and stones from the
bodies of the invalids.</p>

<p>So matters continue until the <i>mafai</i> considers himself strong
enough to work for his living, when, with the approval of the
<i>tamiluanas</i>, he resigns his <i>mafai</i>-ship in a final ceremony called
<i>Luinj-lare Mafai</i>&mdash;undressing the <i>mafai</i>.</p>

<p>The same man may eventually become a <i>tamiluana</i> (one
who chases devils), or he may become <i>Yom Ap</i> and <i>Yom Elpanam</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, "Grandfather or Guardian of Chaura canoes, and Guardian of
<i>Elpanam</i>."</p>

<p>The <i>mafai</i> is a peg on which many festivals and customs
are hung. The following ceremony is one as occasionally carried
out in the village of M&#363;s. It is called <i>Amutna Kuv</i>&mdash;revealing
to the invalid.</p>

<p>The <i>tamiluanas</i> of the village decorate themselves and go
to a place called <i>Mal</i>, outside the village, and there clear a
certain spot in the midst of thick bush. They take with them
a few yards of red cloth, a cage containing a score of fowls, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
basket of pork, and other things, and hide all under different
bushes at some distance from the cleared spot.</p>

<p>To it, with a number of followers, they lead the <i>mafai</i> in
procession, and a dance with singing is held.</p>

<p>While the party in general is dancing, the <i>tamiluanas</i> take
the <i>mafai</i> apart to one of the bushes and point out to him
one of the concealed articles, telling him that it is a gift miraculously
sent him by a deceased relative. All then return and
join the dancing party. This action is repeated until all the
articles are pointed out to the <i>mafai</i>.</p>

<p>The red cloth is then torn into strips and distributed to the
men for loin cloths, and all the other objects are taken to the
<i>mafai's</i> house, while afterwards the people renew the singing
and dancing for the whole night.</p>

<p>The site in <i>Mal</i> the people consider to be something like
Hades, and they believe that the spirits of the dead, immediately
after life is ended, take up their abode in it. Consequently
they never approach it on ordinary occasions, nor do they gather
coconuts from the place, though the palms grow there thickly.</p>

<p>When a person becomes ill, or when it is desired to expel
the devil from anyone, the <i>tamiluanas</i> first resort there to
consult with their household spirits, or familiars, and to obtain
"devil-expelling" leaves.</p>

<p>In the event of their attempts failing, they go to another
spot in distant jungle called <i>Passa</i> (a former settlement of the
M&#363;s people), where they suppose the souls of their ancestors
sojourn.</p>

<p>The burial ceremony is peculiar, and the whole <i>motif</i> of it
seems to be that if the corpse return to the village the ghost
will be able to accompany it and haunt the place.</p>

<p>If a death should occur in the village proper, the natives,
after conveying the corpse to the "deadhouse" in <i>Elpanam</i>, for
fear of the spirit, barricade themselves for a time in their
houses, and keep fires burning before the doors.</p>

<p>When a Kar Nicobarese becomes moribund he is taken to
the "deadhouse," or "house of pollution," and there left to die,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
with bunches of "devil-exorcising" leaves about his bed. After
the end has come, all friends bring a piece of cotton, in which
the corpse is swathed subsequent to being washed in coconut
water. It is then lifted by two men and, while kept in an
upright position, lowered down the ladder and delivered to a
number of friends waiting below, who try to prevent its burial.
These, with the intention of returning it to the house occupied
in life, attempt to bear it towards the village, but the movement
is opposed by the rest of the community, who are in the
majority. Much struggling takes place about the corpse, and it
is very roughly handled, but at length it is forced towards the
burial-ground and flung violently into the grave. Sucking pigs
and fowls are then killed, and after blood from them is sprinkled
over the body, are placed beneath the arms and legs.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The
grave is then filled up, and on the third day is decorated, and
marked by three bamboos, to which young coconuts are fastened
for the purpose of engrossing the attention of the ghost. The
house of mourning is also covered with young coco-palm leaves
and sprinkled with sacrificial pigs' blood.</p>

<p>After the death of a person, houses, canoes, and the ground
about the village are covered with palm leaves to prevent the
ghost from entering.</p>

<p>Theoretically, all the possessions of the deceased are destroyed,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
but the practice is now confined to personal property, as spoons,
<i>d&aacute;os</i>, clothes. Some of his pigs are killed, a few coco palms cut
down, and on rare occasions his house is burnt, or unroofed and
left deserted. What remains goes to the children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no belief in a future state, but it is thought that,
for a time, the ghost will haunt the vicinity.</p>

<p>For some days after a death the <i>tamiluanas</i> institute ceremonies
for the purpose of expelling the ghost from the village.</p>

<p>Tall bamboos, festooned with palm leaves and cotton, are
erected on the shore at <i>Elpanam</i>, and the <i>tamiluanas</i> take their
place beneath. After scattering stones and ashes, they run
about, uttering a mouse-like squeak the while, until they capture
the spirit and imprison it in a bunch of leaves. Several
men then grasp the bunch, and placing in it a small figure,
made in human likeness of coco-palm leaf, twist up the whole,
and throw it into the sea.</p>

<p>From time to time villages go through ceremonials somewhat
similar, for the purpose of expelling such devils as may be
haunting the place.</p>

<p>Shaving the head is sometimes indulged in as a sign of
mourning, together with frequent bathing and abstinence from
work. A man will also change his name to show grief at the
loss of a friend, and will take another title if it comes to his
knowledge that a namesake, even a comparative stranger, is
dead.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>It was customary for widows to have one of their fingers
cut off, and if they refused to submit to the operation, the
posts and doorway of their houses were gashed and notched.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Accounts of two interments which differed somewhat from
the usual practice may be worth giving here.</p>

<p>The first is that of "Distant," headman of S&aacute;wi, who was
buried with much pomp.</p>

<p>The corpse was dressed in a good suit of English clothes,
and silver wire was wound about it from head to feet. This
was because he was once a <i>mafai</i>, and the usual ceremony of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
<i>Luinj-lare</i> (renunciation of the character) had not been performed.
Upon the wire, thirty-two pairs of spoons and forks were placed
crosswise. Necklaces made of two-anna pieces (240 to each,
and two dollars) were attached to head and neck, and the
body was wrapped in forty yards of red cloth.</p>

<p>The corpse was then borne in procession by twenty-four
men and women to the house of the relatives (contrary to
custom), and was then taken to the graveyard. Two very
large and four ordinary pigs were burnt alive as a sacrifice,
and seven pigs and eight chickens were buried with the body
after their blood had been sprinkled over the corpse.</p>

<p>The following night, the ceremony of <i>Fota Elmot</i> (wiping
away tears) was performed, on which occasion fifty pigs and
twenty fowls were slaughtered to feed the guests, and thirty-two
pairs of spoons and forks, necklaces of silver coin and
wire, and teakwood boxes full of the dead man's property,
were broken up and thrown into the sea.</p>

<p>Again, on the eighth day, the final mourning ceremony was
gone through, when, in honour of the thirteen villages of the
island, thirteen pairs of spoons and forks, and sundry other
articles, were destroyed, and the guests were entertained at a
feast of equal munificence to that they had shortly before taken
part in.</p>

<p>The second case is that of a man, nearly one hundred years
old, who owned a third part of the village of Lap&aacute;ti.</p>

<p>The body was neatly wrapped in cloths under a curtain in
the "deadhouse." A sort of open coffin, about 7 feet long and 4
feet wide, was made, and six thick green canes were fastened to
it, three to the head and three to the foot, each cane about 50
yards long.</p>

<p>When all was ready the coffin was drawn into the "deadhouse"
up a sloping plank, and when the corpse had been placed
within, two women got in and lay on either side the body,
embracing it with their arms. When the coffin was lowered to
the ground two big men also laid themselves down in it.</p>

<p>The large <i>Elpanam</i> was filled with a crowd of about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
thousand people, young and old, from other villages. Of these,
a hundred from the southern and a hundred from the northern
villages seized the long canes at either end, and dragged the
coffin up and down in competition until the canes were broken,
when, the grave being dug, the body was buried.</p>

<p>This ceremony is performed only when those of the highest
repute are interred.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Once in every five years the villages in turn remove all
their pigs, and keep them in sties in the jungle. The surroundings
of the village are then offered to the public for cultivating
fruit and vegetables, and the people from other villages arrive
and make gardens, which are open; there is no need for
fencing, since there are no pigs to cause damage.</p>

<p>The reason for all this is that after demolishing the <i>&ntilde;&aacute;-kop&aacute;h</i>
(sacrifice to the dead), during the festival of <i>Kana Awn</i>,
the yams and other vegetables and fruit with which they are
loaded are scattered about the houses, and grow abundantly;
to obtain some profit from this unplanned result this custom
has been introduced.</p>

<p>The people in general have their large vegetable plantations
at a distance, but for immediate use there are some smaller
gardens near the village. The <i>tamiluanas</i> informed the people
that in consequence of the flourishing condition of these latter,
the devils were angry, and might cause the island to be drowned
by a deluge, and that to save themselves they should uproot
part of the plants. Accordingly, the greater portion of the
yams and other vegetables were destroyed; some of the people
doing it willingly, others with discontent.</p>

<p>The Kar Nicobarese seem to hold much the same belief with
regard to an eclipse as do the Chinese and some of the peoples
of India.</p>

<p>They think the moon is actually being swallowed by a
serpent, and throughout the night both young and old refrain
from sleep, and occupy themselves in driving the serpent away.
Providing themselves with tins and planks, they beat them, causing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
a tremendous din, and shout, "Alas! alas! do not devour it,
let the moon alone and go away."</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>In the buying and selling of the larger canoes the natives of
Chaura act as middlemen&mdash;seeming to possess a monoply of
intermediation in this business as they do of pottery making.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>The canoes are not made at Chaura; there are no suitable
trees on that small island to construct them from. The Chaura
people obtain them&mdash;very cheaply&mdash;from the central groups
(where many are made, and where others, obtained from the
southern group, are also sold), and sell them again to the Kar
Nicobarese, making four or five times in the transaction what
they themselves pay.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>"As the Kar Nicobarese are timid, and allow themselves to be
bullied by the natives of Chaura, who assume an overbearing
manner towards them, as well as towards their southern neighbours&mdash;all
of whom are dependent on them for pots, which cannot
be made at any of the other islands&mdash;the feeling predominant
among the Kar Nicobarese as regards the people of Chaura is
one of fear, and they evince every desire to avoid incurring their
ill-will and resentment,"<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> even to the point of submitting to be
flagrantly cheated in their canoe barter! The extortionate price<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
they have to pay may have something to do with the high value
the Kar Nicobarese set on their large canoes.</p>

<p>The business of purchasing these is accompanied by its
peculiar ceremonies. In an instance at M&#363;s, after busy bargaining
for pots and a large canoe, the Chaura people, in the evening,
feasted, each man in his friend's house, and then at midnight
assembled at the <i>Elpanam</i>, with the chief men of M&#363;s, and
amused themselves singing songs in turn, and partaking of betel-nut
and toddy. There they got through the preliminaries to
purchasing the canoe, and the articles intended as its price were
exhibited. After the bargain was closed the M&#363;s people returned
to the village, leaving the Chaura men at the house in <i>Elpanam</i>.</p>

<p>The articles agreed on were handed over.</p>

<p>Next evening a great feast was given to the people of Chaura
by those of M&#363;s; in each house a young pig was killed for the
purpose. At night all the people assembled in a house in <i>Elpanam</i>,
and after dining, amused themselves singing songs by turns.</p>

<p>The Chaura people then left the island in the canoe they had
sold, for it is the custom to do this, and bring the canoe back
on a later occasion. They were provisioned for the voyage by
the village of M&#363;s.</p></div>


<p>The dances of the Kar Nicobarese are always held at the
open ground of <i>Elpanam</i>. With a <i>mafai</i>, a fire, or a trophy of
spoons and forks as a centre, the people form large circles, or
parts of circles, according to their number, and move slowly round
to left and to right. The sexes dance separately, the one ring
within the other, or join the ends of their chains to form one
large circle, but form up very compactly, each person grasping
his neighbour's shoulder with outstretched arms intertwined. The
dance is somewhat monotonous, and consists of two or three steps
sideways, and a pause, with a stamp with the foot or a swing of
the body, and then the same movement in the reverse direction,
and so on, over and over again, to the accompaniment of the
performer's songs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>The refreshments partaken of are coconuts, tobacco, and toddy.
The latter is supplied in large quantities, and gives rise to much
intoxication, which, however, only seems to result in increased
friendliness and a drunken sleep.</p></div>

<p>When a quarrel takes place the participators often seek
revenge in destroying each other's coconut trees, but in severe
cases a man will probably burn his own house down. Possibly
this is done on the supposition that the enemy will suffer more
from self-reproach at having been the cause of the destruction
than from any other form of punishment he could undergo.
Or possibly it is a mild instance of a peculiar form of "amok,"
to a variation of which curious psychological state the Nicobarese
are undoubtedly subject on occasions when they consider
themselves injured. Several instances that have been recorded
of kindred occurrences will perhaps best illustrate this conduct
and idiosyncrasy.</p>

<p>1. A man named Kuhangta purchased some things from
the traders on the responsibility of another named Tumilo.
As the traders pressed Tumilo for immediate payment, he
urged Kuhangta to settle the matter with coconuts forthwith.
Kuhangta was enraged at this, and killed several of his own
pigs, and also set fire to his own house. He threatened, in
addition, to kill any one who approached, and kept a <i>d&aacute;o</i> in
hand for that purpose. Lorenzo therefore went to the owner
of a gun and begged that Kuhangta might be killed. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
request was not granted, and, in the end, the headmen of various
villages succeeded in reconciling the two, and obtained from
Kuhangta a promise of good behaviour. Such cases, however,
do not always end so tamely as in this instance.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>2. "About noon, Offandi, the headman of M&#363;s, came to my
hut with a paddle in his hand which he was trying to break,
muttering at the same time, 'I am a very rich man. All this
land and everything in it is mine. You were a very poor man,
and I gave you land, gardens, houses, and many other things.
You now call me a liar, and so I am angry, and am going to
dig up a grave.' He repeated this over and over again, and
would not say anything else. I was quite puzzled, and could
not understand what he meant. I asked him if he was angry
with me, and he said, 'Yes, I am angry, and there is another man.'</p>

<p>"While this was going on, his wife and a number of men
and other women came running after him from the village. As
soon as he saw the crowd, he hastily broke the paddle in my
hut and ran off with the handle to the burial-ground, and
began to dig at the grave of his late father.</p>

<p>"The crowd ran off to the burial-ground, caught hold of him,
and tried to drag him out of the place. A regular struggle
commenced, and the women began to cry out, some, 'We fear,
we fear,' others, 'Don't pollute us.' The Burmese and other
traders looked on from a distance with great surprise.</p>

<p>"As the matter began to grow serious, I went across and
ordered Offandi in a commanding tone to leave the place and
come away at once. He came away quietly enough to my
hut, and the crowd with him. After some inquiry, he said
that 'Friend of England' had insulted him, and, therefore, he
wanted to open the grave of his (Offandi's) father and throw
the bones into the sea, adding, 'This man was a very poor
man once. My dead father patronised and gave him land,
garden, and everything, but now he calls my father a liar, and
so he must be punished.' I then sent word to all the chief
men of the village, and told them to come over to my place
that night.</p>

<p>"Accordingly, at about seven o'clock, all the people, including
the parties of the dispute and the <i>Kahokachan</i> (village judge),
assembled, and as this was a family quarrel, I asked the judge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
to investigate the case, and settle the matter according to their
own customs. A good deal of argument then took place between
Offandi and 'Friend of England,' the crowd, acting as jurors,
gave their opinion, and at last the judge made a long speech,
in which he pointed out the faults of both parties, and ended
the case by ordering them to be reconciled. 'Friend of England'
apologised to Offandi, admitting his bad language, and the
latter forgave him, everybody departing quite satisfied.</p>

<p>"The origin of the affair was that Offandi and 'Friend of
England,' with a few others, jointly cleared a spot in the jungle
to make a garden. 'David Jones,' a cousin of the former's
and a junior partner in the concern, wished to plant only coconut
shoots, a plan to which 'Friend of England' raised an objection,
as he wanted to grow only yams and other eatables. Offandi
tried to intercede on behalf of 'David Jones,' on the plea that
the land was given him by his deceased father, and therefore he
was at liberty to plant what he liked in the allotment. Then it
appeared that 'Friend of England' said, 'Your father was a
liar.' Being enraged by this, Offandi rejoined, 'Shall I dig up the
bones of my father and throw them into the sea?'&mdash;a very great
indignity and bad omen to the party causing it. 'Friend of
England' replied,'Yes, you had better,' and hence the trouble."<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p></div>

<p>The cases of "amok" that occur among the Malayan peoples
are, as often as not, the outcome of ill-health and long-continued
brooding over some imaginary or trifling insult. Similar occurrences
happen from time to time among the Nicobarese, and as
they are an almost exact parallel, they possibly afford material
proof as to the Malayan affinities of these people.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Sam-tat-yon was always a loafer who obtained his food gratis
from the traders at Malacca, and slept in any bazaar he could.
At dawn one morning, Osman&mdash;an old man&mdash;a servant of Yusuf
Hussain, got up from his bed and went to the beach, and while
returning to his hut, saw Sam-tat-yon coming out of it with an
axe in his hand.</p>

<p>Osman called out to Ali Hussain and Yusuf Hussain (both
foreign traders) and told them what he had seen, and Sam-tat-yon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
hearing this, dropped the axe, and with a small American knife,
kept for husking coconuts, attempted to kill both Ali and Yusuf.
They, however, got beneath the floor of the hut and made their
escape, the former with a slight wound.</p>

<p>Sam-tat-yon then fell upon old Osman and slew him with the
knife.</p>

<p>He next went up to some Burmans who were gambling, and
dispersed them, after doing one of them some slight injury. Sam-tat-yon
then ran off to the village of Perka.</p>

<p>At Perka, there were sleeping in a house his brother&mdash;a man
named Kichyeti,&mdash;one Chestu Chulia, and some women and
children.</p>

<p>Sam-tat-yon entered, closed the door, and stabbing his brother
first in the chest and then in the abdomen, killed him. At the
first cry of Kichyeti, Chestu Chulia and the others got up, and
giving the alarm, tried to snatch away the knife. Some women
from a neighbouring house then came and helped to arrest the
murderer, whose own wife&mdash;one of those arriving to rescue
Chestu Chulia&mdash;was wounded in the struggle.</p>

<p>The populace not unnaturally wanted to kill Sam-tat-yon on
the spot, but they were prevailed upon to keep him for trial.
Not being accustomed to guarding prisoners, and not liking to
keep him in any of their houses, lest they should become polluted,
they prepared a strong wooden cage, similar to those made for
pigs that are to be slaughtered, and left the man in it with his
hands tied.</p>

<p>(The Nicobarese fear the presence of a desperado, and are too
ignorant to know how to guard him, and for these reasons they
always kill the men of whom they entertain fear.)</p>

<p>After three or four days of the cage, Sam-tat-yon became
quite subdued, and answered any inquiries about the occurrence.
He fully admitted his behaviour, but attributed no cause to it.
He simply said that he had been unwell for the last month, and
could not take his meals properly, that he was unable to drink
coconut milk, but lived upon warm water, and that he had not
slept for several nights. In such a state of health he lost his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
senses, and therefore committed the crime. He stated that the
Mussulman who was killed by him was not an enemy, but on the
other hand, he and all the traders were his friends. Regarding
his brother, he said that he had been kind to him.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>The proceedings of a man who wishes to obtain a name as a
wizard are rather curious. He will, for instance, frequent pig
wallows, and, sitting in the mud, collect the bristles left there by
the pigs when cooling themselves; or again, he visits the graveyard
at night and disturbs the graves. He generally lives by
himself in the jungle, doing no work, but stealing pigs, chickens,
and coconuts from others. Having made a reputation for witchcraft,
he is held in much fear by the community, but to balance
this advantage, if they consider themselves injured by his practices,
it is not impossible that they may some day combine and murder
him.</p>

<p>Besides ridding themselves of an unpleasant neighbour, it
would seem that they also hope by such an action to cause the
destruction of an evilly-disposed spirit.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>1. "Tham Koi, son of Katha, having beaten a countryman to
death in Chaura, made the following statement: 'Kanunla, a
<i>menluana</i> (medicine man) and sorcerer, is addicted to sodomy
and theft. He bewitched my father, who became very ill. I sent
for Kanunla to come and shampoo my father, who gradually got
worse. I became enraged with the <i>menluana</i>, and waited until
he got on the ladder of my hut, when I struck him on the left
side of the neck, so that he fell down. I went down and struck
him again thrice, and he died. I then went and told my neighbours
Kamrang Piko, Okio, Cher, and Tachoi what I had done,
and asked them to help me remove the corpse, which we took in
a canoe and threw into the sea. Kanunla did not make a noise.
No one knew of this at the time because it was in the evening,
and very dark. The villagers knew of it on the following morning.'"
&mdash;<i>Diary of Mr Obed Elias.</i></p></div>

<p>2. Tekwa was the adopted son of Iskol's father, and was
always living in Iskol's house. Eventually he became a thief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
and robbed the people of their fowls and pigs, and he was
supposed to be a "devil-man" or wizard.</p>

<p>It happened that a man named Sutro died after suffering a
long time from dysentery and consumption, and it was supposed
by Iskol and his friends that Tekwa was the cause of this death.
Tekwa perceived this, and hid himself in a place called <i>Hat-Own</i>;
but three days later, Iskol and his friends, Natla, Sundran, and
Nawi, after consulting together, brought him thence to a place
called Ranai, where, after giving him toddy, they killed him by
strangling him with a rope, subsequent to breaking his joints at
the knees and elbows.</p>

<p>The same night they buried the corpse in <i>Kofent&eacute;</i> (the place
of pollution), near the graveyard, and a day or two later, killed
a couple of pigs as a ransom or sacrifice.</p>

<p>The reason for these murders&mdash;or popular sentences,&mdash;when
not because of witchcraft, seems to be somewhat obscure, but can
possibly be found in a general dislike for the victim, or for some
act or event with which he is associated.</p>

<p>A woman of Kenuaka had been shot to death with arrows by
her fellow-villagers. She was suffering badly from secondary
syphilis, and was very poorly off, but the reason given as the
immediate cause of her death was the untimely delivery of a
still-born child. The body was buried in the usual manner, and
everybody contributed cloth to wrap the corpse in, according to
custom.</p>

<p>A double murder took place in the village of Perka, whose
headman was named Kan-ny&aacute;na. The victims, who were detested
by the village, were put to death because of their misconduct.
Six men participated in the affair, but as there was no idea among
the natives that they should be punished, no one could be brought
to point them out to the Agent. The testimony of witnesses
showed the light in which they were regarded. Tamikal, wife of
one of the deceased, stated:&mdash;"On a certain night, while I was
sitting at the entrance of my house, my husband was angry with
me, and attempted to thrash me. I cried aloud. Then, suddenly,
a lot of men, armed with sticks, came into the house and com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>menced
to beat the dead man. I was afraid and ran away, and
cannot say what happened further, nor could I recognise any of
the assailants. I am glad, however, that the two men were killed,
for they were wicked men."</p>

<p>Kokali, son of one of the deceased, seconded the statements of
his mother, and said, "I am glad that they were killed; they were
very bad men; the village now enjoys peace."</p>

<p>The culprits were finally apprehended, and one of them,
Ringangmareng, grasping a stick, cried in great anger, "Why do
you call me here? I am the man who killed those wicked villains
with the very stick I have now in my hand. Do you wish to
handcuff me and carry me to Port Blair? Do so if you like, but
you must not take <i>mah</i>"&mdash;pointing to the chief Kan-ny&aacute;na.</p>

<p>(The Nicobarese possess much affection for their chiefs, and
also value their <i>tamiluanas</i> highly. When one of the latter was
being taken to Port Blair because of misconduct, the headman of
his village entreated that two other men might be substituted for
the "doctor.")</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>Suicide is not recognised as an institution of Nicobarese life,
but cases of it do occur somewhat occasionally.</p>

<p>Pin-re-ta was a good man, very rich, and had no wife nor
any enemies, and therefore his fellow-villagers could show no
cause for the occurrence. One day, his servant-boy, who was
sleeping in the cookhouse, was aroused by a noise as of a pig
being beaten. Going down the ladder to see what was happening,
he noticed that the pig-sty was in flames, and that a pig
had been killed, and then he saw Pin-re-ta, who, standing below
the cookhouse, axe in hand, threatened to murder him. The
boy ran off to the jungle, where people were making a garden;
and they, returning with him, found that Pin-re-ta, after setting
fire to both his houses, had thrown himself into the flames, and
was burnt to death.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>While the negotiations were going on for the plot of land
on which the Schoolhouse and Agent's bungalow stand, it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
found that in buying land in Kar Nicobar, the bargain must be
made with the chief, as overlord of all the land in the village,
but that he, on his part, is bound to share the proceeds with
all who are interested in it.</p>

<p>The price fixed on for the piece in question (about 8&frac14; acres)
was:&mdash;twelve black suits, one piece of red cloth, six bags rice,
twenty packets Chinese tobacco, and twelve bottles rum.</p>

<p>These things were distributed amongst the people of the
village by the headman, Offandi, who retained nothing for himself;
but for some time subsequently he was in bad odour for
having given up the land to the Government, and for a long
period the Agency was looked on with much disfavour.</p>

<p>The Kar Nicobarese have a deeply rooted aversion to the
settlement of strangers in their midst, and more than once have
expelled from their island intruding missionaries. Nowadays,
great discontent is caused by the traders leaving agents to
carry on business during the south-west monsoon, when the
weather is not suitable for vessels to remain amongst these
islands.</p>

<p>The habit the natives have of using their crossbows in the
immediate neighbourhood of the villages is sometimes productive
of fatal accidents. Two men were shooting at S&aacute;wi, and one of
them having shot at a bird and missed, the arrow in falling
pierced the chest of his friend, who had run forward to recover
it. Several similar mischances have occurred recently in M&#363;s;
in the latest, a lad named Sinkin shot at a bird, and his arrow,
glancing from a tree, struck a man, Ka Noe, and entered his
side, causing a serious, but not fatal, wound.</p>

<p>The not infrequent mishaps that occur on the annual canoe
voyages undertaken by the Kar Nicobarese to Chaura have
much to do with the stationary condition of the population of
the island. Canoes containing thirty to forty men are regularly
sent out by the villages of the island, and when they meet
with bad weather a total loss is not an uncommon occurrence.</p>

<p>During the months of October, November, and December<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>&mdash;the
first half of the north-east monsoon&mdash;or fine season, the
people of Kar Nicobar live a busy life.</p>

<p>At first they are engaged in husking the coconuts which
are to be exported to Calcutta and Moulmein. The wages
they obtain for this work are the value of 100 nuts for husking
1000 nuts. They are generally paid in cloth, or two-anna bits,
which are utilised by manufacture into head&mdash;or neck&mdash;ornaments.</p>

<p>Next they are employed in landing the goods of the Burmese
kopra-makers, and in carrying the same to their villages, for
as no ships can anchor on the north-east coast during the season,
everything has to be transported by the natives. The people
of M&#363;s carry the things of those traders who own stores in
their villages; in like manner the villagers of Malacca go to
S&aacute;wi Bay, and carry the goods of those Burmans who dwell
amongst them. They are remunerated according to the following
scale:&mdash;</p>

<p class="sblockquot">It costs a trader about 30 rupees to transport one cartload of goods from
M&#363;s to Malacca.</p>

<p>When this work is done, the Nicobarese are employed in
erecting huts, to serve the traders as bazaars. Each hut is built
by contract by one man with the help of friends, and on its
completion the owner has to give the contractor 14 to 20
yards of red cloth, a Burmese betel-box and a <i>d&aacute;o</i>, and
besides this, has to supply the men with food until the work is
finished.</p>

<p>After the hut has been built, the natives proceed to make
a fence round a small compound, in order to prevent pigs from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
destroying the stores of kopra. For this they are remunerated
separately.</p>

<p>While some are thus engaged, others take passages in such
of the trading vessels as go to Kamorta and other islands, in
order to assist in husking coconuts and making kopra, work for
which they receive one nut in ten. These opportunities are
much desired by the natives, since they are at liberty to take
home with them any number of Chaura pots, rattans, bamboos,
paddles, and canoes; and masters of trading boats are glad to
employ the Kar Nicobarese, for the people of the other islands
are too indolent to collect and prepare the nuts, but sell them
on the trees.</p>

<p>While the men are so occupied, the women and children are
busy helping the traders to make kopra, and for this service
they are fed twice daily, and receive presents at the termination
of the work.</p>

<p>Careful accounts are kept by the Nicobarese of their transactions
in coconuts, by means of a tally-stick (<i>kenr&#257;ta kuk</i>,
Kar Nicobar), on which all the nuts that pass from them to
the traders are registered by various kinds of notches.</p>

<p>A regular account is kept of the months, so that festivals
may be held in proper season, and a daily account is kept of
a child's age until the time arrives for piercing its ears, an
operation taking place soon after the first year.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>FAUNA OF THE ANDAMANS AND NICOBARS</h3>


<p class="noidt"><span class="smcap">Previous</span> to entering into any details of the fauna of the Andamans
and Nicobars, a glance at the depths of the surrounding
ocean is interesting, and to a great extent explanatory of the
peculiarities occurring in both groups: it is well known that the
soundings of the adjacent seas clearly indicate the extent of time
during which masses of land have been isolated, and the facts
of this case seem to fully explain the variation and numerous
peculiarities of the local fauna.</p>

<p>Preparis Island is situated at the tail of a 100-fathom (to be
more particular, 50-fathom) bank projecting from the Arakan Yoma
Peninsula. It is continental in its fauna, and possesses monkeys
and squirrels.</p>

<p>Between it and the Cocos Islands is a depth of 150
fathoms.</p>

<p>The Andaman group, from Cocos to Little Andaman (except
the South Sentinel, which is isolated), all stand on a 100-fathom
bank (actually 50 fathoms).</p>

<p>All these are connected by a 200-fathom line with the Arakan
Yoma Peninsula.</p>

<p>Narkondam and Barren Island both rise from a sea approaching
1000 fathoms in depth.</p>

<p>The Andamans and Nicobars are separated by a channel with
depths of 600 fathoms.</p>

<p>Soundings about the Nicobars are at present very incomplete,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
but the Archipelago seems capable of division into two groups,
each standing on a 100-fathom bank.</p>

<p>The northern of these consists of the compactly-situated central
islands, and possibly Kar Nicobar, and is separated from the
southern (Great and Little Nicobar and the adjacent islets, all
perhaps surrounded by a 50-fathom line) by a channel with
approximate depths of 200 fathoms.</p>

<p>The Nicobars stand at the termination of a 1000-fathom bank,
projecting from the Arakan Yoma Peninsula, and from thence
also curving east and south towards Sumatra, thus enclosing a
long tongue of deep sea, over 1000 fathoms deep, that is connected
with the Indian Ocean by the channel separating them from
Sumatra.</p>

<p>This deep sea that surrounds the islands everywhere but on
the north, shows that, so far as need be taken into account for
present purposes, they have never been connected with the Malay
Peninsula or Sumatra&mdash;a condition that is further shown by the
almost total absence of any members of the Malayan fauna&mdash;although
they may at one time have been a prolongation of
the Arakan Hills.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"It cannot, however, be asserted that this latter theory of
connection derives, <i>prim&acirc; facie</i>, much support from a consideration
of their fauna; and if they ever were in uninterrupted communication
with the Arakan Hills it must apparently have been at an
immensely distant period, for not only are all the most characteristic
species of the Arakan Hills, as we now find them, absent from
the islands, but the latter exhibit a great number of distinct and
peculiar forms, constituting, where the ornis is concerned, considerably
more than one-third the number known."&mdash;Hume,
<i>Stray Feathers</i>, vol. ii.</p></div>

<p>From the above details, it is to be inferred that not only
have the Nicobars&mdash;if ever in connection with the mainland&mdash;been
longest separated, but that they have also been disconnected
among themselves for a great extent of time. At a
later period the Andamans were cut off from the continent, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the process by which they have been broken up into islands is&mdash;except
in the cases of Narkondam and Barren Island&mdash;comparatively
recent. This theory is fully borne out by the greatly
localised nature of the fauna, nearly every island possessing its
own peculiar species of terrestrial mammals.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mammals.</span></h3>

<p>The mammalian fauna of the Andamans and Nicobars is now
known to consist of 35 positively identified species, 1 sub-species,
and 4 others whose status is still doubtful.</p>

<p>Of this total of 40 animals, 19 are found in the former (if we
leave out a dugong, which, though at present reported from the
Andamans, will certainly be found to occur in the Nicobars), 22
in the latter. Only two species are common to both groups, and
both these are bats&mdash;<i>Pteropus nicobaricus</i>, a wide-flying species
found also in the Malay Peninsula and Java, and <i>P. vampyrus</i>&mdash;of
which further knowledge will doubtless show that each group
possesses its own variety.</p>

<p>To the Andamans 12 species are peculiar, the others being
<i>Mus musculus</i>; <i>Felis chaus</i>, whose identification is doubtful; 4
bats; and a monkey, <i>Macacus coininus</i>, in all probability introduced.</p>

<p>The Nicobars possess 14 peculiar species and 1 sub-species, and
the remaining members are <i>Mus alexandrinus</i>, and 6 bats.</p>

<p>Not only is the peculiarity marked among the terrestrial, but
among the winged animals, which form so large a part of the
fauna; also, of the 7 bats occurring in the Andamans, 3 are
endemic, while the same is the case with 5 of the 11 in the
Nicobars.</p>

<p>Thus it is to be noted that in the Andamans all the 11
terrestrial mammals&mdash;except <i>M. musculus</i>, <i>M. coininus</i> (introduced?)
and the doubtful <i>F. chaus</i>&mdash;are peculiar, and also 3 out
of 7 bats; while in the Nicobars, only 1 species&mdash;<i>M. alexandrinus</i>&mdash;of
10 terrestrial is other than endemic, and of the 11 bats 5
(nearly half) are peculiar. Remarkable as is the state of things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
with regard to the terrestrial, it is equally notable where the flying
mammals are concerned.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy features of the fauna are the preponderance
of bats (16 species) and rats (13 species)&mdash;which together
constitute nearly three-fourths of the total number of mammals
known to occur in the islands&mdash;and the absence of practically all
representatives of the ungulates, squirrels, carnivores, and flying
lemurs, which are characteristic of the surrounding regions and
abound on other islands at equal distance from the mainland.
From the Malayan islands where these occur they differ in that
"they are surrounded by water of relatively great depth, while
the others lie within the 50-fathom line. This paucity of mammalian
life cannot be regarded as due to an unfavourable environment,
since all the natural conditions on both Andamans and
Nicobars are perfectly suited to the support of a rich and varied
fauna"; yet so great is it that it appears safe to assume that these,
"contrary to the case with the shallow-water islands, were isolated
at a time when the mammals now characteristic of the mainland
did not exist there." In fact, we are almost driven to conclude
that they never were at any time a portion of the continent, but
were formerly only far nearer to it, far larger and far more compactly
situated&mdash;a hypothesis that is further supported by an
investigation of the birds appertaining to them.</p>

<div class="sblockquot"><p>"As yet no species have been discovered whose origin may be
referred to the remote period of a land connection: such mammals
as are now known are evidently of very recent origin, as in scarcely
an instance has their differentiation progressed further than in the
case of members of the same genera found on islands lying in
shallow water. The question at once arises, therefore, as to the
means by which they have arrived where they now are. Flights
from the mainland would readily account for the distribution of
the bats; but the presence of the other mammals seems impossible
to explain otherwise than through the agency of man. With the
single exception of <i>Tupai nicobarica</i>,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> all are types well known to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
be closely associated with man throughout the Malayan region.
Moreover, the period of time necessary to the development of the
peculiarities of the native Andamanese would undoubtedly be
ample to allow the formation of any of the species known from
either group of islands, since in a biologic sense it has been vastly
longer to the smaller, more rapidly breeding, animals than to man.
The introduction, intentional or otherwise, of a pig, a monkey,
a palm-civet, two or three species of rats, a shrew, and perhaps
also a tree-shrew, at about the time when the various islands were
peopled by their present human inhabitants, would amply account
for the existence of the present mammal fauna with its striking
peculiarities."</p></div>

fauna among the islands. (The letter A indicates material obtained

<h3><span class="smcap">Birds.</span></h3>

<p>The birds of the Andamans and Nicobars have always been
better known than the mammals, particularly since Mr A. O.
Hume, with a number of collectors, made a cruise round the
islands in a steamer in 1873, which resulted in the discovery of
many new species, and a careful analysis of the avifauna.</p>

<p>In spite of what is to be expected from their position, the
islands derive the bulk of their species from the distant Indian
region, while the Indo-Burmese and Indo-Malayan regions are
represented to a far less degree.</p>

<p>One of the most striking features is the extreme paucity of
rasorial birds&mdash;peafowl, junglefowl, pheasants, partridges, or any
of the natural genera into which these divide, and which are all
well represented in the Arakan Hills. The next point is the
highly specialised character of the ornis, for, excluding waders
and swimmers, more than a third of the species are peculiar to
the islands; while still more remarkable is the extent to which
it is localised in the several groups between which is nowhere
a break of more than 80 miles. Even more noteworthy are the
details: for instance, the Andaman <i>Hypothymis</i>, which, as a rule,
is a very distinct form, is replaced in the Nicobars by one which,
although not precisely identical with the Indian form, is far more
closely allied to this than the Andaman <i>Tytleri</i>. Each group has
its distinct harrier eagle, red-cheeked paroquet, oriole, sunbird,
and bulbul. Two woodpeckers are peculiar to the Andamans,
but neither extends to the Cocos or Nicobars. The latter group
possesses three distinct but closely allied species of <i>Astur</i>, each
confined to separate islands.</p>

<p>So far as the species not peculiar to the islands are concerned,
the influence of the Indian sub-region has vastly predominated;
and if we look to the genera the preponderance is still more
marked, and thus it seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that
the ornis has altogether a very far stronger affinity with that
of the Indian region than with those of either the Indo-Burmese
or the Indo-Malayan. Yet this involves great difficulties, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
if we take Port Blair as a centre we shall find that its average
distance in all directions north and east from Tenasserim (where the
Indo-Malayan fauna predominates), and north of this from the
Indo-Burmese sub-region, is less than half its distance from the
nearest point of the Indian sub-region.</p>

<p>That so many of the characteristic birds of the Arakan Hills,
especially the Rasores, should be entirely wanting, we may partly
account for by the supposition that the mountains and the chain
of islands never were continuous, and that the same agency that
raised the Arakan Hills only raised portions of their continuation
above the sea-level, so that, therefore, the islands have never been
connected with Pegu. If, however, the groups first appeared and
have ever since remained as detached islands, it is inconceivable
how the great bulk of the work of colonisation should have gone
on from a region so distant while so little should have been done
from others less than half as far away.</p>

<p>Colonisation in no ordinary sense, however, can explain these
facts. But the case of Sumatra, which, although only 80 miles
distant from Great Nicobar, and itself the first link of a great
chain, teems right up to Acheen Head with species unknown to
the Nicobars, is perfectly comprehensible in the light of our
knowledge of the deep sea existing between it and these latter
islands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p>If we conclude that the avifauna of the islands of the Bengal
Sea is essentially Indian and not Indo-Burmese and Indo-Malayan,
we must accept the fact with the qualification that we find it here
in a most imperfect and mutilated form, lacking more or less
entirely a large proportion of its characteristic genera, many of
which are the strongest and most widely distributed, and to which
the climate would appear in every way congenial.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The Madras and Bombay Government gun-carriage factories are supplied
with Andamanese timber, which, so far, is understood to have given them
satisfaction. Such timber has been sent to Roorkee for the Military Gymnasium,
as being the best suited in India for its purposes. The Indian Marine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
Department also takes it regularly. Andamanese timber has also been supplied
to Woolwich Arsenal. These facts show that Andamanese timber is of value
to such establishments as gun-carriage factories, arsenals, gymnasia, and ship-building
yards.</p>

<p>For various reasons, most of the Andamanese timbers will probably be
found to be best marketable in a converted form. It is believed that such converted
timbers will be found useful for six large trades at least, viz., paving
wood-blocks, gun-stocks, pianoforte manufacture, furniture, organ building&mdash;for
which <i>Padouk</i> is pre-eminently suitable&mdash;and electric light and telephone
fittings. If <i>Gurjan</i> should turn out, as is believed to be probable, to be of use
for paving wood-blocks, then the supply would be very large.</p>

<p>Two forms of converted timbers may be specially noticed as probably
marketable in large quantities, viz., railway sleepers, and tea shooks. It is
believed that there are several timbers which would stand the strain of railway
traffic; and as regards tea shooks, <i>Gurjan</i> is used for this purpose in some mills
in Assam, and of this particular wood there is an unlimited supply all over the
Andamans, which could probably be delivered locally at a price which would
enable it to compete well in Indian markets with other timbers used for tea-boxes.</p>

<p>The supply of mangrove billets for firewood, at points where it can be easily
and cheaply shipped, is very large in the Andamans, and it is thought possible
that a very profitable and lasting Indian trade might be established in firewood.</p>

<p>At present, no trade exists at all in gurjan oil, and, as above stated, the
supply of <i>Gurjan</i> trees is unlimited. It is believed that the supply of <i>Gurjan</i> in
India has largely been worked out, therefore that in the Andamans should
become valuable. A small quantity of gurjan oil is extracted in the Settlement
and used chiefly for mixing with earth oil for application to shingle roofs. The
uses to which this oil is put are so many that the possibility of a profitable
trade in the Andamanese supply seems to be beyond question.</p>

<p>For the construction of houses, bridges, and jetties, the following species
are chiefly used in the Settlement:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Padouk.</i>&mdash;Posts, trusses, purlins, common rafters, battens, floor and wall
planking, shingles, doors, and windows.</p>

<p><i>Koko.</i>&mdash;Joists, common rafters, battens, fillets, floor-planking, doors, and
windows.</p>

<p><i>White Chuglam.</i>&mdash;Floor and ceiling planking.</p>

<p><i>Pyimma.</i>&mdash;Posts, joists, common rafters, purlins, frames, floor and wall
planking, shingles.</p>

<p><i>Lakuch and Mowha.</i>&mdash;Posts, girders, beams, and purlins.</p>

<p><i>Gangaw.</i>&mdash;Posts, girders of bridges, 3-inch planking over sluices, and
sluice-gates.</p>

<p><i>Thitmin.</i>&mdash;Inside walling and jambs, shelves, and any light work.</p>

<hr style='width: 15%;' />

<p>In boat-building the following species are used by the Marine Department:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Padouk.</i>&mdash;Hull planks, keel, stem and stern posts, ribs of large boats, and
thwarts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span></p>

<p><i>White Chuglam.</i>&mdash;Oars.
<i>Pyimma.</i>&mdash;Thwarts.
<i>Thitmin.</i>&mdash;Masts and spars.
<i>Chooi.</i>&mdash;Ribs of small boats.</p>

<p>For furniture, <i>Padouk</i> and <i>Koko</i> are chiefly used. <i>Didu</i> is the only species
utilised for the manufacture of tea-boxes at Port Blair. Bark for tanning
purposes is obtained from various species of <i>Mangrove</i> and from <i>Terminalia
procera</i>. <i>Mangrove</i> also gives the most suitable wood for use in the furnaces
of the Settlement steam-launches.</p>

<p>Firewood for ordinary purposes is obtained from all hard-wood species
other than those in demand for timber.</p>

<p>Gurjan <i>oil</i> is obtained from three species of <i>Dipterocarpus</i>. The tapping
operations extend from 1st January to 30th April. The daily outturn averages
7 lbs. per man, the greatest flow of oil taking place in the month of March.
The mixture used for steeping house-shingles consists of 3 lbs. of gurjan oil to
1 lb. of earth oil and 1 lb. of Alford's metallic paint.</p>

<p>The minor produce of the Andamans comprises several useful species of
bamboo and cane, used in house-building and in the construction of furniture,
rattan roots for walking-sticks, and two species of palm (<i>Nipa fruticans</i> and
<i>Licuala peltata</i>), the leaves of which are used for thatching.</p>

<p>The inner bark of <i>Sterculia villosa</i> is used for making ropes for timber-dragging
purposes.</p>

<p>With regard to the capabilities of the forests for export purposes, there is an
abundance of mature and over-mature <i>Padouk</i> throughout the Andamans.
Gurjan oil trees, <i>Gangaw</i> (the Assam "Ironwood"), suitable for sleepers, and
<i>Didu</i>, suitable for tea-box planking, are extremely abundant. For the extraction
of these species labour alone is required.</p>

<p>The forests are situated, in most cases, on the coast, or on or near to
navigable creeks leading to the sea, and are capable of easy and economical
working.&mdash;<i>Andaman and Nicobar Gazette.</i></p>

<p>The number of children among the Andamanese is probably understated.
The census operations have brought to light a new tribe, the T&acirc;b&ocirc; of North
Andaman, and have proved the recently discovered K&ocirc;r&acirc; tribe to be comparatively
numerous. In explanation of the small numbers of the newly discovered
T&acirc;b&ocirc; tribe, the census party were informed that when a contagious disease was
recently introduced among the T&acirc;b&ocirc;s by the Ch&acirc;ri&acirc;r or K&ocirc;r&acirc; tribes of the
coast, they proceeded to kill off all those attacked until very few of the tribe
were left.&mdash;Supp., <i>And. and Nic. Gazette</i>, March 2, 1901.</p>

<p>The foreign residents number 16,106 (viz., 4102 free and 12,004 convict),
who are all located at or near Port Blair; but as the amount is arrived at by
deducting the Andamanese and the natives of the Nicobars from the total
population of the two groups, allowance must be made for inaccuracy due to
estimation only of the Jarawas, &Ouml;ng&eacute;s, and Shom Pe&#7749;.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX E</h2>

<h4>GOVERNMENT SCHOOLS, PORT BLAIR</h4>


<p>The daily average number of pupils on the rolls of the Settlement schools
for 1900 was 229&mdash;190 boys and 39 girls. The daily percentage of attendance
was about 92 of both sexes.</p>

<p>Of the former attending the schools, 133 were the children of free persons
and ex-convicts, and the remainder were of convict parentage. With the
exception of 6, all the girls were of the latter class.</p>

<p>Inquiry shows that the percentage of boys attending the schools, born of
free parents, is about 36 to the 20 born of convict parents, who remove their
sons from school immediately the compulsory limit of age (12 years) is
passed.</p>

<p>The number of schools in the Settlement is seven, and the teaching staff
consists of&mdash;six vernacular masters, including a gymnastic instructor, one
assistant English master, fifteen vernacular assistant teachers and monitors,
five sewing masters and mistresses, one carpenter, and a blacksmith.</p>

<p>The highest class in the English is the fifth, and in the vernacular school
the sixth, in which mensuration and transliteration from Urdu into Roman
characters are taught. The curriculum adopted is that in vogue in the Punjab.
All vernacular education, as well as instruction, in the Industrial School is
granted free of charge, but a fee of 1 rupee per month is imposed on those
who are taught English.</p>

<p>There were 82 boys in the Industrial School learning both carpenter's
and blacksmith's work, and the earnings during nine months amounted to
Rs. 56. It is proposed to teach boys who are not strong enough for the above
trades the use of the sewing-machine, with a view to turning them into
tailors.</p>

<p>The girls do not make much progress in their literary studies, but their
work in the sewing classes is more satisfactory. The reason for this is that
free persons and ex-convicts do not send their girls to school, and convict
parents withdraw their daughters as soon as they reach their tenth year.
Efforts are made to overcome the prejudices of the parents, but without
success. There are many difficulties in this matter with regard to native
children, and at present it can only be hoped that by degrees prejudices will
gradually break down, and the girls be allowed to make a better start in life
than they are at present given.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>In Port Blair the locally born of both sexes may be fairly described, as a
whole, as astonishingly wicked. Their delight is to do mischief, and to worry
each other and their elders in an ingenious variety of underhand and crooked
ways, including the perverse and fruitless lawsuit. It is very much better
that their minds should be turned on athletic sports and games, while they can
still join in them, than on such matters as these; and hence grounds for cricket
and football with all requisites have been granted, and a gymnastic instructor
has been obtained for teaching the boys. It is believed that satisfactory progress
is made, and that much benefit will be derived from the lately established
gymnasium, in which 100 boys are (1901) being trained.</p>

<p>From these figures it appears that, on the whole, the population has
remained fairly stationary since the last census. With regard to Chowra,
I am inclined to believe that the decrease is due not only to the fact that
many of the natives have migrated to Camorta and other islands of the
group, but to the number of the children now on the island having been
understated to the enumerators. Much of the increase shown in the central
group and Teressa is attributable to immigration, and very probably also
to incorrect information having been furnished to the enumerators, either
at this census or the last one. As to the Shom Pe&#7749;, it is still impossible to
ascertain their numbers.&mdash;E. H. Man&mdash;Supp., <i>And. and Nic. Gazette</i>, March 2,

expedition against a section of the Jarawa tribe, who had recently murdered
some wood-cutters. He rushed the last of several hostile camps by night, and
took a number of prisoners; but, treading in the ashes of a smouldering fire at
the moment of success, he caused it to blaze up, and being seen by a retreating
native, was shot through the chest with an arrow, and died almost immediately.</p></div>

140&deg;, while in 1866 the Andaman Committee found the temperature to be
between 158&deg; and 163&deg;. In 1857 Dr Mouat landed, and writes of "a natural
boiling spring, the waters so extremely hot that they rendered the sea in the
immediate neighbourhood warm enough to roast crabs in their shells," and about
the same date Dr von Liebig records a broad but thin sheet of nearly boiling
water issuing from beneath the lava, and the sea warm for many yards to a
depth of more than 8 feet. Earlier still, in 1831, we have Dr Adam's account,
which states that 100 yards from shore the water was nearly boiling; the stones
and rocks on shore exposed at low tide were smoking and hissing, and the
water was boiling all round them.</p></div>

third, still more closely approaching it in appearance and principle, is found in
New Ireland and the New Hebrides.</p>

owing to the low-lying swampy formation of the larger portion of the island.
Hereditary syphilis is believed to be common among the &Ouml;ng&eacute;s, having been
possibly introduced at some remote period prior to the occupation of 1858.
Whether it is to be traced to Malay pirates, or through the Jarawa tribes to
the Settlement of 1789, will never be ascertained, but, in coming to a conclusion,
the Nicobarese must also be considered as a factor in the case.</p></div>

platforms for the married people to sleep on; several large baskets were slung
up to the roof, and two rows of pigs' skulls ornamented the walls, showing from
their numbers (about 500) that there was no lack of food."&mdash;M. V. Portman.</p></div>

supposed that this has been adopted from some Point de Galle fishing-boat
wrecked on the islands, for early writers never mention its existence (Sir H.
Yule, <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i>); but it is much simpler to conjecture it to be
a copy of the same feature from the Nicobarese canoe. On the other hand,
there is no argument against it being original, for the aborigines of New South
Wales and Queensland have a canoe that is in every way almost the exact
counterpart of the Andamanese vessel.</p></div>

grew, nuts drifted to its changing shores and took root, until, as more and

another low island of similar formation, also possesses forests of indigenous
coconuts.</p>

<p>Mr E. H. Man writes:&mdash;"The story given by Tanamara, regarding de
R&ouml;epstorff's murder, is very incorrect. The murderer (a havildar of the Madras
Infantry detachment then stationed at Nankauri) was under trial for having
assaulted a convict. After recording a lot of contradictory evidence, de R.
adjourned the case, whereupon the Madras Infantry jemadar pleaded on behalf
of the havildar. The magistrate reproved him for his interference, whereupon
the latter went and informed the havildar that he would probably receive a
severe sentence which might result in his dismissal from the army. This so
enraged the havildar that on de R. riding past the M. I. barracks a few hours
later the same day, he shot him from his room. The havildar was the crack
shot of the Madras army, having twice carried off Commander-in-Chief's prize.
He shot himself on seeing that he had inflicted a mortal wound. De R. died
within a minute or so. It was his wife who despatched news of the affair to
Port Blair by a <i>bagla</i>, which had just arrived in Nankauri Harbour. In five
days I arrived and held the inquiry. Mrs de R&ouml;epstorff during those five days
had a natural horror of the M. I. sepoys, and she would not allow any of them
to approach the house. Her Indian servants and others remained with her
as before."</p></div>

are in many cases rendered impotent. At Kar Nicobar, Teressa, and Bompoka,

traditions of a Creation, a Fall, a Deluge, and a future state
have been recorded as extant among the Andamanese, there is reason to
believe that these accounts are merely the Christian religion as formerly
taught in the Andaman orphanages, and distorted among the natives; for, while
the southern tribes have a legend of a stone house where the Deity was born,
the northern tribes, who have not been brought into contact with the Settlement,
have no such tradition;" but Mr E. H. Man records traditions of a
Creation, Fall, and Deluge, obtained from aborigines possessing no knowledge
of what had been taught to the few small children at the Orphanage (chiefly
reading and writing, sewing, basket work, etc.), and moreover, doubts whether
any of the latter were capable of giving an intelligent&mdash;if any&mdash;account of the
views held by Christians on these subjects.</p>
<p>"The Andamanese traditions do not resemble those of Christians....
Savages in other parts of the world," writes Mr Man, "possessed traditions on
the same subjects before missionaries or other Christians ever visited them."</p></div>

the South of India and the trading towns which formed the emporia of the
spice islands, notably Johor, Singapore, and Malacca. When the Portuguese,
at the commencement of the sixteenth century, first visited these places, they
were amazed at the concourse of foreign vessels assembled there. When this
intercourse began it is impossible to say, but it was probably much earlier than
the above. Snouck-Hurgronje, writing of Acheh, says that the settlement of
Klings from Southern India in that country is of great antiquity; and that the
Tamils were the leaders in this commercial enterprise in Malaya is clearly
shown by the pure Tamil words,&mdash;chiefly connected with commerce, though
not altogether so,&mdash;which have found their way into Malay.... The Malay
for 'ship,' <i>kapal</i>, is pure Tamil ... the pure Tamil <i>padagu</i>, 'boat,' may
reasonably be taken to be the parent of the Malay <i>prahu</i>. If this be so, it
would seem as if the Tamils first introduced the Malays to even the most
elementary navigation, and, as they gave them <i>kapal</i>, taught them to 'go
down to the sea in ships.' ... They do not seem to have settled down or
intermixed with the Malays to any great extent,&mdash;not certainly so much as in
Acheh, where considerable colonies of Tamils took up their abode. Their
object being merely commerce, they went as they came, returning year by
year as the monsoon favoured."&mdash;"Southern India and the Straits," W. A.

of having children, dividing labour, and by means of their offspring providing
for old age. It is therefore entered into and dissolved almost at pleasure. The
causes are innumerable, but incompatibility of temper is perhaps the most
common; when they are tired of each other they do not say so, but put the

attentions which a young man (of the Sarawak Dyaks) is able to pay the girl
he desires to make his wife, as helping her in her work, and carrying home her
load of vegetables, as well as making her presents, there is a peculiar testimony
of regard that is worthy of note. About nine or ten at night, when the family
is supposed to be asleep within the mosquito curtains in the private apartment,
the lover quietly slips back the bolt by which the door is fastened on the
inside, and enters the room on tip-toe. He goes to the curtains of his beloved,
gently awakes her, and she, on hearing who it is, rises at once, and they sit
conversing together and making arrangements for the future, in the dark, over
a plentiful supply of sireh leaf and betel-nut, which it is the gentleman's duty to
provide. If, when awoke, the young lady arises and accepts the prepared
betel-nut, happy is the lover, for his suit is in a fair way to prosper; but, if on
the other hand, she rises and says, 'Be good enough to blow up the fire,' or 'to
light the lamp,' then his hopes are at an end, for that is the usual form of
dismissal. Of course if this kind of nocturnal visit is frequently repeated, the
parents do not fail to discover it, although it is a point of honour among them
to take no notice of their visitor; and if they approve of him, matters take their
course, but if not, they use their influence with their daughter to ensure the
utterance of the fatal 'Please blow up the fire.'"</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) "Customs of the Minahassers," Hickson's <i>Celebes</i>, p. 272.&mdash;"Two young
people meet at the <i>mapalus</i> (communal gatherings for work, followed by a
feast), and over the feasting and singing become interested in one another, and
fall in love. Then follows the courtship, which is not supposed to be open and
above-board, but is, nominally at least, carried on in secret. It consists in
nocturnal visits of the young man to the young woman's house, visits which
although frequently attended by immorality, are not necessarily so, and are
often perfectly decorous and formal.</p>
<p>"The young woman prepares a mat for her lover, and after dark he comes
to visit her. The parents are, of course, aware that their daughter is receiving
a visitor, and are indeed proud that she should be thus so sought after; but at
the same time they warn her to be cautious. The lover departs again before
daybreak, in order that there may be no gossip in the village about their
engagement until all is settled. These visits extend over some weeks, and at
last one morning he remains until the day has broken, as a sign that the
engagement may be formally announced."</p></div>

find it as much as they dare venture to do, to go so far as Chaura for their large
canoes and pots. As it is, many lives are lost at sea. (In 1899 at least 29
were drowned in returning from this island, and more recently 12 or 13
were similarly lost.) Chaura is situated midway between Kar Nicobar and
Nankauri Harbour and Kamorta, where the principal purchases are made by
the Chaura people.</p></div>

questioned, said that he had bought it from the same man. On further enquiry
it was found, that while the Chaura middleman had <i>promised</i> to give 25 rupees
in kind to Tanamara (only part of which had yet been paid), he would not let
Offandi have it till he had delivered to him a long list of articles (<i>e.g.</i> cloth,

circles of men and women were formed, linked hand in hand, one circle
within the other. The dance continued for hours, accompanied by a monotonous
chant. Sometimes the two circles moved in opposite directions, or
expanded to their utmost stretch and contracted again by advancing towards
the centre. In posturing they kept time with the singing, all turning to
right and then to left, raising their arms or letting them fall together. The
inner circle knelt on the left knee, placing their heads to the ground, but
still holding each other, while the outer circle, also hand-in-hand, stepped
over them and became the inner one. This was frequently repeated, and
in this and other movements the dance consisted. The circles consisted of
about 200 people each."&mdash;"A Visit to Car Nicobar, 1851," by Captain

and Little Nicobar. It no doubt was established in these two last before they
became disunited, as sufficient time has elapsed for a distinct variation to occur,
while the far greater depth of sea between them and Kachal would indicate a
separation anterior to the arrival of the species.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_221_221" id="Footnote_221_221"></a><a href="#FNanchor_221_221"><span class="label">[221]</span></a> The presence of a megapode in the Nicobars, a genus that occurs also in
the Indo-Malayan region, is the most interesting feature of the islands' avifauna.
Dr A. R. Wallace says, in <i>The Distribution of Animals</i>: "The Megapodid&aelig; are
highly characteristic of the Australian region ... only sending two species
beyond its limits (<i>M. cumingi</i> and <i>M. lowi</i> in the Philippine and North-West
Borneo Islands), and another in the Nicobar Islands, separated by about 1800
miles from its nearest ally in Lombok. The Philippine species offers little difficulty,
for these birds are found on the smallest islands and sandbanks, and can
evidently pass over a few miles of sea with ease; but the Nicobar bird is a
very different case, because none of the numerous intervening islands offer a
single example of the family. Instead of being a well-marked or differentiated
form, as we should expect to find if its remote and isolated habitat were due to
natural causes, it so nearly resembles some of the closely allied species from
the Moluccas and New Guinea, that had it been found with them it would not
have been thought specifically distinct. I therefore believe that it is probably
an introduction by the Malays (Dr Guillemard states that this bird is often seen
in captivity in Malaysia), and that, owing to the absence of enemies and general
suitability of conditions, it has thriven in the islands, and has become slightly
differentiated from the parent stock."</p>
<p>The megapode also occurs on the Cocos Islands, but not on the Andamans
intervening between these and the Nicobars. This may be explained either by
the fact that it may formerly have existed on the Andamans, where it has been
exterminated by the carnivorous palm-civet common in that group, or that,
owing to the hostility of the natives, voyagers were deterred from stopping
there and thus causing the introduction of the bird, a course they would be
the less persuaded to attempt in that there were no coconuts to attract them.</p></div>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
